**Let's play a game**, shall we?

Pick a number. Not too large, though! You're about to do some quick math on it.
(I'll play along with 4.)

Okay. Ready? Good.

Now take your number and square it. (4 squared is 16.) Then, add your original
number to the square. (16 plus 4 is 20.) Finally, add forty-one. (20 plus 41 is
61.)

And now -- your result -- is it prime? Ha! I thought so. (61 certainly is.)

This little trick is due to Euler, who pointed out in 1772 that the polynomial
($ f(x) = x^2 + x + 41$) returns prime numbers for small integers --- indeed,
all nonnegative integers up to and including 39. Since then, the quest for
other such "prime-generating" polynomials has fascinated number theorists from
around the world. As a little exercise, you may try convincing yourself that
there is no *perfect* prime-generating polynomial; that is, that there will
always be at least one integer input that gives a composite output.

But I digress. Here is what matters: The integers ($ x $) for which ($ f(x) $)
is composite are the deviants, the rebels, the ones who refuse to play along
with Euler's little game.

Forty is the first such integer.

One hundred fifty-nine is another.

Welcome to the 159th Carnival of Mathematics.

The Carnival always has a special place in its heart for clever ways to teach
children various math concepts. And this one's no exception. In [Set Theory for
Second
Grade](http://mathmisery.com/wp/2018/06/14/set-theory-for-second-grade/), Manan
talks about how he designed an engaging lesson on set theory (and common
multiples!) for second graders. A quote from his students: "Can you hang this
in the hall so that everyone can see the college math we did?"

In [British Mathematical Colloquium, days 3 and
4](https://cameroncounts.wordpress.com/2018/06/14/british-mathematical-colloquium-days-3-and-4/),
Peter Cameron recounts in excellent detail the last couple days of the
Colloquium (it reads like a mini-Carnival!). Days 1 and 2 are linked within.

In [Sum of Cubes is Square of Sum... And
More!](https://pballew.blogspot.com/2018/06/sum-of-cubes-is-square-of-sum-and-more.html),
Pat Ballew begins with a fact that most high-schoolers are taught, and then
rather suddenly finds himself deep in a fascinating rabbit hole. (Editor's
note: I encourage you to read the author's _On This Day in Math_ series; I
would list all thirty of the past month if I could...)

In [Thinking about the Law of Quadratic
Reciprocity](http://voices.norwich.edu/daniel-mcquillan/2018/06/29/thinking-about-the-law-of-quadratic-reciprocity/),
Dan McQuillan gives a fast-paced overview of one of my personal favorite
theorems in number theory.

> Mathematics, the way it is currently written, can be difficult to read.

> (or after, or during) the reading of a proper treatment or rigorous proof.

> purpose, and the hope is that it reads like a good story that’s both
> interesting, believable and easily verifiable.

_Just for fun!_

In [Magical
Learning](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/06/16/magical-learning/), John
Cook reports the results from an informal Twitter poll he conducted: "If a
genie offered to give you a thorough understanding of one theorem, what theorem
would you choose?"

In case you missed it, Christian at the Aperiodical is running [The Big
Internet
Math-Off](http://aperiodical.com/2018/06/announcing-the-big-internet-math-off/).
It may not have the intense moment-by-moment drama of the World Cup, but the
daily tidbits of math are definitely worth subscribing for.

In [Math Explained through
Anagrams](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2018/06/20/math-explained-through-anagrams-2/),
Ben Orlin constructs a frankly impressive amount of anagrams for various parts
of math. And they're all illustrated! (Editor's note: I also enjoyed [this
piece](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2018/06/27/powers-great-and-small/) by
the same author. I don't want to spoil it, but here is a wonderful quotation:
"I sometimes think that there are no puddles in math;" says Orlin, "there are
only oceans in disguise.")

That's all I have for you this month! Come back next time when Robin at
[Theorem of the Day](http://www.theoremoftheday.org/) will host the 160th
Carnival of Mathematics!
