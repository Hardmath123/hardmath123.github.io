After a chance conversation at our lab retreat, I got curious about what tides
"sound" like. I downloaded the NOAA's [water level
data](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stations.html) for Boston Harbor from
the start of my PhD until today and sped it up by a factor of about 200
million.

You can clearly hear the tone representing the daily tides (pleasingly, it's
tuned to "middle C"... get it?). The vibrato or "beating" is caused by the
difference between the solar and lunar constituents, and corresponds to the
semimonthly spring/neap tides. Finally, if you speed it up even more, you can
hear three annual "scrapes" corresponding to yearly variation (caused by the
Earth's axial tilt?).
