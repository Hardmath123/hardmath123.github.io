</em></center>
                <h4>Thursday, May 14, 2015 &middot; 3 min read</h4>
<p>Apparently it <a href="https://github.com/tj/n">has</a>
<a href="https://github.com/madbence/node-drawille">recently</a>
<a href="https://github.com/paulirish/github-email">become</a>
<a href="https://github.com/nathan/gistogram">fashionable</a> on Github READMEs to put in
a screenshot of a tty rather than explain the usage in actual words. There’s
nothing wrong with them for the most part, but what bothers me is that all
these screenshots are <em>ugly</em>. The links above are in increasing order of
beauty.</p>
<p>It turns out that taking nice screenshots is filled with icky pitfalls and
undocumented secrets. Here’s how you do it <em>right</em>—on a Mac running a
relatively recent OSX.</p>
<h2 id="basic-principles">Basic principles</h2>
<p>First of all, make sure you really want to use a screenshot. Plaintext is
generally enough to convey what your project does, and all the text is
copyable.</p>
<p>You should only be using a screenshot if your project has some curses-esque
behavior—messing with colors and drawing and raw mode and all that jazz.</p>
<p>When taking a screenshot, make sure your terminal profile (custom colors, dark
background, etc.) doesn’t interfere with anything. Also, make sure your
terminal prompt (<code>$PS1</code>) is sufficiently normal. Yes, a plain <code>&gt;</code> is
minimalistic and pretty. But it’s confusing—are you running bash, or is the
prompt part of your program’s interface?</p>
<p>Finally: use <em>small</em> windows. It’s hard to read text if you take a screenshot
of an enormous terminal window and shrink it down.</p>
<h2 id="key-combos">Key combos</h2>
<p>Most people know that you can use cmd-shift-4 to enter screenshot mode and
select part of the screen. A lesser-known trick is that you can press “space”
to enter <em>window selection mode</em>. This lets you click on a window to take a
screenshot <em>of that window</em>; and you end up with this (click to enlarge):</p>
<p><a href="static/terminal-3.png"><img src="static/terminal-1.png" alt="This should be a sample screenshot"></a></p>
<p>Why is this better than taking a normal screenshot and cropping? Because this
method has the underlying code actually draw a fresh, high-resolution copy of
your window—even in full-screen mode. It also includes that pretty shadow
(which, by the way, is rendered with a translucent PNG alpha channel so it
looks good on every background).</p>
<p>It’s also, to be honest, much easier for the lazy.</p>
<h2 id="command-line-screenshots">Command-line screenshots</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, this screen capture mechanism has a command-line API.
Unsurprisingly, it has terrible documentation.</p>
<p>The command itself is called <code>screencapture(1)</code>. You want to feed it the
undocumented-in-the-man-page <code>-w</code> option to specify the window ID.</p>
<p>To get the window ID, you can use AppleScript’s <code>tell app &quot;$APPLICATION&quot; to id
of window $N</code> command, where <code>$N</code> is the index of the window from “top” to
“bottom”. You want to set <code>$APPLICATION</code> to <code>Terminal</code> and <code>$N</code> to “1” to get
the focused window. Putting it together, we have:</p>
<pre><code>$ screencapture -o -l $(osascript -e &#39;tell app &quot;Terminal&quot; to id of window 1&#39;) screenie.png
</code></pre><p>This is, of course, terribly un-useful because it’ll take a screenshot of the
window the moment you type this in. I would suggest prefixing it with <code>sleep
5;</code>, and running it in a separate window (<em>not</em> a separate tab—that would get
captured in your output!). This gives you five seconds to switch to your target
window and get ready for the screenshot.</p>
<h2 id="animating-with-imagemagick">Animating with Imagemagick</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you can only really show how your project works with an animated
GIF.</p>
<p>In general, it’s good to keep GIFs short and small. They should loop cleanly:
the easy way to accomplish this is by running “clear” at the end of your
program so that the terminal state is restored to what it was before you ran
it.</p>
<p>To make a GIF, you need to take multiple screenshots by looping
<code>screencapture(1)</code> (you don’t really need a delay, since the process of
capturing is so slow):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">rm screenies/screenie-*.png
N=0
while true; do
    screencapture -l $(osascript -e &#39;tell app &quot;Terminal&quot; to id of window 1&#39;) screenies/screenie-$(printf &quot;%05d&quot; $N).png
    printf &quot;Created %05d\n&quot; $N
    let N=$N+1
done
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you can use Imagemagick (<code>brew install imagemagick</code>) to stitch them into
a GIF using the <code>convert(1)</code> command. Make sure you specify <code>-alpha remove</code> for
each frame so that the shadows get rasterized properly:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">convert $(for a in screenies/*; do printf -- &quot;-delay 1x60 -alpha remove %s &quot; $a; done; ) result.gif
</code></pre>
<p>This step will take a while and output a monstrously huge GIF, because the PNGs
are pretty big. You can use Imagemagick <code>-quality</code> and <code>-resize</code> to shrink them
substantially:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">mkdir screenies-compressed
cd screenies

for a in *; do
    convert -quality 80 -resize 60% $a ../screenies-compressed/$a
done;
cd ..
</code></pre>
<p><img src="static/terminal-2.gif" alt="This should be a sample screencast"></p>
<p>If you take screenshots often, it’s probably worth aliasing these commands in
your <code>~/.profile</code>.</p>
