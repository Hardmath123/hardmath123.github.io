</em></center>
                <h4>Sunday, September 13, 2020 &middot; 3 min read</h4>
<p>A 2014 <a href="https://www.math.ksu.edu/~rozhkovs/LeWitt_cubes.pdf">paper</a> by
Rozhkovskaya and Reb titled “Is the List of Incomplete Open Cubes Complete?”
complicates Sol LeWitt’s celebrated 1974 artwork, “Incomplete Open Cubes”. The
artwork is a <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/691091">gallery</a>
of 122 three-dimensional structures; they are meant to be all distinct
connected subsets of edges of the unit cube that result in a 3D figure — or,
in LeWitt’s words, “all the ways of the cube not being complete”. The
complication, noted by the paper, is that two of the structures are identical
up to rotation; they should instead be mirror reflections of each other.</p>
<p>Have art historians realized yet? I would like to think there is some deeper
philosophical significance to this bit of trivia. The exercise in exhaustive
enumeration of incompleteness is itself incomplete — and, we cannot help but
overlook the incompleteness, just as we cannot help but imagine the missing
edges of any of the 122 almost-cubes.</p>

<p>I have <a href="eucalyptus.html">meditated on the art-historical significance of chirality
before</a>, so today I want to talk about something else. I don’t
know about you, but when I see LeWitt’s almost-cubes, I feel the need to
submerge them in a tank of soapy water. Why? To see what shape the films take,
of course! Is that irrational? Perhaps, but <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/146945">writes
LeWitt</a>, “Irrational thoughts
should be followed absolutely and logically.” It turns out that my thought
isn’t hard to follow — if not absolutely and logically, then at least
computationally.</p>
<p>The shape of a soap film is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface">minimal
surface</a>, that is, the surface
with minimal area that obeys the boundary conditions of the “loop” that the
film forms within. The definition doesn’t depend at all on the properties of
soap: any film-forming substance should — in the absence of other forces,
such as gravity — contract to the same shape as a result of surface tension.
These shapes can often be pleasing and unexpected.</p>

<p>Now, because finding the surface is a question of continuous minimization, we
should be able to easily apply automatic differentiation — at least, to a
discretization of the problem.  Here is the algorithm: we start with a mesh
grid of points and triangulate it. Then, we compute the surface area by
repeated application of Heron’s Theorem to the triangles. Finally, we
differentiate the total area with respect to the positions of the points, and
nudge the points towards less area. The full source code for this adventure is
available <a href="static/minimal-surface/minimal-surface.ipynb">here</a>. (By the way,
I’m using PyTorch out of habit, but perhaps TensorFlow would be more
appropriate because of its oddly LeWittian logo.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Before I give you the results, I want you to take a moment to try and imagine
what the soap films will look like. I think it’s an interesting exercise in
qualitative reasoning, and, in any case, LeWitt’s work all but pleads for us to
see what isn’t there.</p>
<p>For starters, we can reduce the entire problem from 122 cubes into just a
handful of cases. Simply ask: how many distinct-up-to-symmetry “loops” are
there on a cube?  Let’s do casework by face count: there is 1 loop with one
face (the “square”), 1 loop with two faces (the “L”), and 2 loops with three
faces (the “U” and the “corner”). The rest are accounted for by complement: a
four-face loop is also a two-face loop.</p>
<p>This yields a total of 4 cases — much more manageable! And indeed, I’ll
suggest that you start with Case 1, the “square”, since the answer in that case
should be obvious.</p>
<hr>
<p>Okay, now, the results!</p>
<p>Case 1 is easy; we already know the answer. The soap film is just flat, because
its boundary is planar.</p>
<p><img src="static/minimal-surface/case_1.gif" alt="Case 1, the square"></p>
<p>Case 2 is less obvious — I would not have predicted this outcome! It turns
out that the soap film tries to “flatten” itself into the hypotenuse. What are
the implications of this? Well, one implication is that if you want to minimize
the material you use to build a tent (without regard to volume), you can do
better than stretching the material taught into large rectangles. Sagging
actually <em>saves</em> material.</p>
<p><img src="static/minimal-surface/case_2.gif" alt="Case 2, the &quot;L&quot;"></p>
<p>You might expect Case 3a to flatten similarly, but because of the up-down
symmetry that can’t happen. Instead, you get a beautiful saddle shape.
Actually, it turns out that all minimal surfaces are saddle-like; if they had
nonzero curvature at some point then you should be able to “flatten the bulge”
to reduce surface area.</p>
<p><img src="static/minimal-surface/case_3a.gif" alt="Case 3a, the &quot;U&quot;"></p>
<p>And finally, Case 3b — sorry this isn’t quite perfectly modeled — tries to
flatten itself around the center, kind of like a tortilla chip.</p>
