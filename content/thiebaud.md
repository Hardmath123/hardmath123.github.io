This summer I was briefly in Vancouver, and after dinner on my last day I found
myself walking several blocks back to my hotel. The night was dark but the
sidewalk was brightly lit and it was a lovely journey. Along the way, I took
this picture:

![A streetlight casts two shadows, blue and
yellow](static/vancouver-streetlight.jpg)

What struck me is how the streetlight casts two shadows, blue and yellow, and
moreover those shadows appear opposite the yellow and blue lamps, respectively.
What could possibly be going on?

Here is an explanation: the two lamps together create a kind of grayish-white
light that bathes the sidewalk. Where the yellow lamp is occluded, the blue
light is dominant, so the shadow is blue. Similarly, where the blue lamp is
occluded, the yellow light is dominant, so the shadow is yellow.

Looking at this scene I'm reminded of painter Wayne Thiebaud's rich, saturated
shadows. You could say the perceptual effect here demonstrates that "white
light" is the sum of all wavelengths, a fact we learn in grade school (I think
there is an exhibit at the SF Exploratorium with a similar concept). But to me,
this also demonstrates the range of what we are willing to call "white." If one
of the lamps were to burn out, our eyes would adjust to the blue or yellow
almost immediately, and we would still see the sidewalk as gray --- we
experience a truly remarkable "color constancy" across lighting conditions. In
this way, when he paints a shadow as a saturated, non-gray color, Thiebaud sees
beyond his own seeing.
