## Toni Morrison, Nobel Lecture

> Speculation on what (other than its own frail body) that bird-in-the-hand might signify has always been attractive to me, but especially so now thinking, as I have been, about the work I do that has brought me to this company.

## Richard Siken, "The Language of the Birds"

> And just because you want to paint a bird, do actually paint a bird, it doesn’t mean you’ve accomplished anything. [(full)](https://poets.org/poem/language-birds)

## Cross-examination in _Brancusi v. United States_

> **Waite:** What do you call this?  
> **Steichen:** I use the same term the sculptor did, oiseau, a bird.  
> **Waite:** What makes you call it a bird, does it look like a bird to you?  
> **Steichen:** It does not look like a bird but I feel that it is a bird, it is 
> characterized by the artist as a bird.  
> **Waite:** Simply because he called it a bird does that make it a bird to you?  
> **Steichen:** Yes, your honor.  
> **Waite:** If you would see it on the street you never would think of 
> calling it a bird, would you?  
> [**Steichen:** Silence]  
> **Young:** If you saw it in the forest you would not take a shot at it?  
> **Steichen:** No, your honor. [(more)](https://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/September-October-2002/story_giry_sepoct2002.msp)

## Donna Tartt, _The Goldfinch_

> But who knows what Fabritius intended? There’s not enough of his work left to even make a guess. The bird looks out at us. It’s not idealized or humanized. It’s very much a bird.

## Adam Savage, "My obsession with objects and the stories they tell"

> And then there is this fourth level, which is a whole new object in the world: the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing, becomes, in its own right, a whole other thing, a whole new object of desire. . . . There are several people who own originals, and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them, hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds, maybe to take a picture, or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner that I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box, and could maybe, without even touching their bird, I swear, get a perfect 3D scan. And I'm even willing to sign pages saying that I'll never let anyone else have it, except for me in my office, I promise. I'll give them one if they want it. And then, maybe, then I'll achieve the end of this exercise. But really, if we're all going to be honest with ourselves, I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with, was it?

## Michael Shewmaker, "The Curlew"

> > Plate 357 _(Numenius Borealis)_ is the only instance in which the subject appears dead in the work of John James Audubon.
>
> He waits alone, sketching angels from the shade---_a kind of heavenly bird,_ he reasons with himself---although their wings are broke, faces scarred, each fragile mouth feigning the same sad smile as the one before it. Offered triple his price to paint a likeness of the pastor's daughter---buried for more than a week---he reluctantly agreed---times being what they are.  
> . . . . .  
> And yet he studies it---from behind the dunes---studies its several postures, grounded and in sudden flight---and not content to praise it from a distance, to sacrifice detail, unpacks his brushes and arranges them before raising his rifle and taking aim.

## Fake birds in Disneyland

(Added June 2023)

From Philip K. Dick's speech, ["How to build a universe."](https://urbigenous.net/library/how_to_build.html)

> In my writing I got so interested in fakes that I finally came up with the
> concept of fake fakes. For example, in Disneyland there are fake birds worked
> by electric motors which emit caws and shrieks as you pass by them. Suppose
> some night all of us sneaked into the park with real birds and substituted
> them for the artificial ones. Imagine the horror the Disneyland officials
> would feel when they discovered the cruel hoax. Real birds! And perhaps
> someday even real hippos and lions. Consternation.

## A representation of an idea

(Added June 2023)

From Eric Kraft's _Where do we stop?_

> The idea that seemed so bright when it was leaping and darting and fluttering through my mind looked dull and dead when I’d caught it and pinned it to my paper … It wasn’t an idea now, but the representation of an idea. It didn’t fly, didn’t flutter by, didn’t catch the eye as I thought it would. (154)

## Symbolic of my entire existence

(Added June 2023)

From CAKE's Mr. Mastodon Farm

> Now due to a construct in my mind  
> That makes their falling and their flight  
> Symbolic of my entire existence  
> It becomes important for me  
> To get up and see  
> Their last-second curves toward flight
> 
> It's almost as if my life would fall  
> Unless I see their ascent.
