                <center><em><p>How to pretend like you have a biased coin</p>
</em></center>
                <h4>Sunday, January 21, 2024 &middot; 2 min read</h4>
<p>Suppose two Bayesians, Alice and Bob, put on a variety show where they take
turns tossing a biased coin and announcing outcomes to a live studio audience.
(Bayesians love this kind of thing—it keeps them entertained for hours…)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, just as Alice goes on stage, she realizes with dread that she
forgot to bring the coin. Thinking on her feet, she mimes pulling a tiny
imaginary coin out of her pocket, and says “This is a biased coin!” It
works—the audience buys it and the crowd goes wild.</p>
<p>She mimes tossing the pretend coin and randomly announces “heads” or “tails.”
Then, she hands the coin to Bob, who (catching on) also mimes a toss. This has
just turned into a Bayesian improv show.</p>
<p>But now Bob has a problem. Should he announce “heads” or “tails”? He could
choose uniformly at random, but after many rounds the audience might get
suspicious if the coin’s bias is too close to 50%. How can he keep up the
charade of a <em>biased</em> coin?</p>
<p>Here’s what Bob does. In the spirit of “yes, and…,” he infers the coin’s bias
based on Alice’s reported outcome (say, with a uniform prior) and samples a
fresh outcome with that bias. So if Alice said “heads,” Bob would be a bit
likelier to say “heads” as well.</p>
<p>Then Alice takes the coin back and does the same, freshly inferring the coin’s
bias from the past <em>two</em> tosses. In this way, the two actors take turns
announcing simulated outcomes to the oblivious audience, while building a
shared understanding of the coin’s bias.</p>
<p>What happens? How can we characterize the sequence of outcomes? Intuitively, we
might expect either a “rich-get-richer” effect where they end up repeating
heads or tails. Or we might expect a “regression-to-the-mean” where they
converge to simulating a fair coin.</p>
<p>The surprising answer is that this process is indistinguishable from Alice and
Bob tossing a <em>real</em> coin with fixed bias (chosen uniformly). A critic lurking
in the audience would never suspect something afoot!</p>
<p>This result is a consequence of the correspondence between the Pólya
distribution and the Beta-binomial distribution.</p>
<p>I have a hunch that this observation could be useful: perhaps in designing a
new kind of cryptographic protocol, or perhaps in explaining something about
human cognition. If you have ideas, let me know!</p>
<hr>
<p>Proof sketch: Model the actors’ belief with a Beta distribution with parameters
$(h, t)$ initialized to $(1, 1)$, i.e. uniform. At each toss the probability of
heads is given by $h/(h+t)$, and the outcome increments $h$ or $t$ by 1. You
can think of this as a Pólya urn with h black and t white balls: each time you
draw a ball, you put it back and add a “bonus” ball of the same color. It is
well-known (look
<a href="https://djalil.chafai.net/blog/2015/11/30/back-to-basics-polya-urns/">here</a> or
<a href="https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2013/REUPapers/Helfand.pdf">here</a> or
<a href="https://www.randomservices.org/random/bernoulli/BetaBernoulli.html">here</a>)
that this is the same as the Beta-binomial process.</p>
