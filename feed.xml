            <description><![CDATA[<p>Thoughts on the chirality of the wood grain in eucalyptus trees</p>


<p>It’s Christmastime, shall we talk about trees?</p>
<p>I was reading about Knuth’s <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fant.html">Fantasia
Apocalypta</a>, and his
description of the “style” he wrote it in contains the wonderfully Knuthian
line “And of course a musical work on the Apocalypse should also contain
calypso.” Naturally I had to look up whether or not this was a linguistic
coincidence, and — in an odd turn of events, since these things usually tend
to work out — it turns out that <em>apocalypse</em> and <em>calypso</em> are <em>not</em>
etymologically related.  <em>Apocalypse</em> comes from the Greek root <em>kaluptein,</em>
“to cover,” and so the <em>apocalypse</em> is the “uncovering” or “revelation” (the
root <em>kel</em> is related to <em>hell</em>). The word <em>calypso</em> is of unknown origin, but
from the West Indies (this is distinct from <em>Calypso,</em> the Greek mythological
nymph, whose name is indeed related to “covered,” or “concealing”).</p>
<p>I shared this with a good friend of mine and she immediately pointed out that
we should check out the word <em>eucalyptus</em>. She was right: <em>eucalyptus</em> means
“well-covered,” referring (not ironically to the bark as I originally thought
but rather) to the calyx, which <a href="http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/indexmag.html?http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artoct07/bj-eucalyptus.html">forms a lid over flowers when in
bud</a>.</p>
<p>That got me thinking about eucalyptuses…</p>
<hr>
<p>Lately I’ve spent a lot of time around the eucalyptuses in <a href="https://trees.stanford.edu/ENCYC/EUCnotes.htm">Toyon and Arboretum
Groves</a> at Stanford and I’ve
noticed that the peeling bark of what I’m 80% sure is the <a href="https://trees.stanford.edu/ENCYC/EUCglo.htm"><em>Eucalyptus
globulus</em></a> (Tasmanian Blue Gum)
seems to climb up the tree in a whirling, helical pattern. I didn’t have the
presence of mind to take a picture at the time but here’s a picture <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus_globulus#/media/File:Starr_031002-0027_Eucalyptus_globulus.jpg">from
Wikimedia
Commons</a>
taken in Maui.</p>
<p><img src="static/eucalyptus-grove.jpg" alt="lots of whooshing eucalyptuses"></p>
<p>Really it’s just beautiful to me, the whorl reaching aspirationally towards the
sky. I’m reminded of Correggio’s <em>Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle</em>, the way the
dog and the tree stump look up together, moving, turning even while frozen in
the painting.</p>
<p><img src="static/correggio.jpg" alt="correggio&#39;s abduction of ganymede"></p>
<p>This much would be believable, just another quirk of nature. But here’s the
truly odd thing: most of the trees seem to grow according to a thumbs-up
right-hand rule; if you were to try and screw them into the ground you would
turn them righty-tighty. <em>So eucalyptuses have some kind of chirality?</em> I
rubbed my eyes, I thought I was dreaming.</p>
<p>But indeed, some hours of study later, I learned that the “spiral grain” is a
real thing in the study of wood formation.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the Real World of economics spiral grain is considered a defect because it
reduces the structural quality of wood. But let us set that aside for a moment
and marvel at the phenomenon itself. I turn to Dr. John Maddern Harris’
wonderfully comprehensive 1989 text <em>Spiral Grain and Wave Phenomena in Wood
Formation</em> (thanks Chandler for finding me a copy!) for details. Harris, citing
confusion about the convention in prior work, carefully defines LH (left-handed
“sinistral”) and RH (right-handed “dextral”) spirals (I wonder if he was aware
of the right-hand-rule convention from E&amp;M, which would simplify matters here).
Perhaps more entertainingly Harris introduces the German words as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Numerous other expressions have been used to describe spiral direction,
reflecting no doubt the notorious difficulty of so doing without waving of
arms and twisting of wrists. In the German literature the terms “sonnig” and
“wider- sonnig” are frequently encountered. Their meaning is “with the sun”
and “against the sun”, and hence (in the Northern Hemisphere!) they relate to
LH and RH spiral grain respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a picture of a eucalyptus from Harris’ book.</p>
<p><img src="static/eucalyptus-spiral.png" alt="spiral-grained eucalyptus"></p>
<p>Certain species do indeed show predilections for certain handednesses.
Furthermore, certain species <em>change</em> handedness over the course of their
lives. In Harald Säll 2002 doctoral thesis <a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:206846/FULLTEXT01.pdf">Spiral Grain in Norway
Spruce</a> I
learned the remarkable fact that the Norway Spruce begins life as a left-handed
spiral grain, but over the decades transitions to a right-handed spiral grain.
The drawing below is from his thesis:</p>
<p><img src="static/spruce-spiral.png" alt="spiral grain reversal in spruce trees"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.conifers.org/topics/spiral_grain.php">We don’t fully understand why trees
spiral</a>, much less how they
pick a direction. The most fanciful explanation I’ve come across — the one I
would like to believe — is that there is some kind of Coriolis effect at
work. But I will admit that both handednesses have been observed in both
hemispheres, which weakens that theory.</p>
<p>At the moment I’m on a quest to find a (translated, ideally) copy of Meyer’s
1949 article <em>Sprachliche und literarische Bemerkungen zum Problem “Drehwuchs”</em>
published in <em>Mitt Schweiz Centralanst Forst Veruschswes</em> (26:331-347) to learn
more about the linguistic history of chirality in relation to spiral grains.
Until then…</p>
<p><strong>Open question:</strong> What’s going on here, why are eucalyptuses right-handed?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dancing Orchards on the I-5]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Investigating number-theoretic patterns in large grids of trees</p>


<p>The last time I spent a long time on I-5, I started thinking about
<a href="envelope.html">envelopes</a>. This time, I started thinking about orchards. As
you drive along the central valley highway, you can see thousands and thousands
of perfect rows of trees. You can actually see them from the top on Google’s
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@36.6590095,-120.643549,2656a,35y,236.91h/data=!3m1!1e3">satellite
imagery</a>;
try zooming in slowly on that point, it’s really quite beautiful.</p>
<p>When you drive by them, you see the side view rather than the top view. In
fact, you see the side view <em>in motion</em> – the trees look like they’re dancing
an elaborate dance, continuously lining up into different formations to form
different rows in different angles. Really, of course, it is you who is moving;
the trees are still but by viewing them from different angles you can see
different “alignments” of the grid.</p>
<p>The effect is most pronounced with freshly-planted trees (or perhaps those are
markers?), where there is no foliage blocking the horizon.</p>
<p><img src="static/orchard.png" alt="orchard"></p>
<p>I didn’t think to make a video at the time, but you can imagine that as the car
moves forwards a little bit, the pattern re-aligns in an incredibly satisfying
way.</p>
<p>I’m intrigued by the multiple “vanishing points” you can see in that picture.
The trees are regularly spaced in a square grid, but somehow there are multiple
(!) irregularly-spaced (!!) points along the horizon to which rows of trees
appear to converge. What’s going on here — is there a pattern to the
patterns? You could either stop reading here to have food for thought on your
next road trip, or you could keep reading for my ideas.</p>
<hr>
<p>The I-5 trees are a variation on a well-known theme: a theme called <em>Euclid’s
orchard</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_orchard">Wikipedia</a>,
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclidsOrchard.html">MathWorld</a>). You stand at
the origin of the plane, and at every integer point there is a line segment
(“tree”) extending one unit upwards perpendicular to the plane. What you see
from your vantage point is Euclid’s orchard. Try to imagine what it looks like;
then, play with a JavaScript simulation of it
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/euclids-orchard/5282060266635264">here</a>.</p>
<p>The main idea of Euclid’s orchard is that trees at integer points (x, y)
occlude trees at any integer multiples of that point (nx, ny), so you don’t see
anything behind them. Also, nearby trees appear taller than farther-away trees
because that’s how perspective works. So there is a “horizon” where in each
direction you either see (1) a tree if the direction’s slope is rational, and
the tree is shorter if its denominator is larger; (2) nothing if the
direction’s slope is irrational. All sorts of fun can be had with this: see for
example a <a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2017/07/22/a-few-words-about-pww-20/">nice connection to the Fibonacci
numbers</a>.</p>
<p>The I-5 orchard in the picture is similar, but now we look upon it from some
height. Imagine mapping each point on the horizon to the direction in which I
would have to point my camera to look directly at that point. The “vanishing
points” have lots of trees along those directions, giving the illusion of
“rows.” What does this mean? It means that if you walked along that ray in
Euclid’s orchard, you would run into trees more frequently than other rays. In
other words, those rays represent directions whose slopes are rational with
small denominators.</p>
<p>Hmm… rational with small denominators… where have I blogged about that
before…? Right — around four years ago, when we
<a href="a-balance-of-powers.html">showed</a> that 2^12864326 begins with the digits
“10000000…” (and other number-theoretic shenanigans).  I wasn’t kidding,
rational approximation really is one of my favorite topics!</p>
<p>At the time I showed you this picture with little explanation.</p>
<p><img src="static/ford-circle.png" alt="Ford circle"></p>
<p>Here is a little more explanation of its significance: as you start filling in
circles to some level, you generate a sequence of fractions called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence">“Farey
sequence”</a> by listing the points
of tangency of the circle and the X axis. The Farey sequence is the list of
completely reduced fractions whose denominators are smaller than some bound.
Putting those two facts together: the points of tangency of the circles
represent points that are “rational with small denominators” — exactly what
we thought our I-9 orchard’s “vanishing points” were!</p>
<p>Looking back at the image, this is somewhat believable. We see a couple of
“strong” vanishing points, and then “weaker” vanishing points in between the
strong ones, and then <em>even</em> “weaker” vanishing points between the strong and
the weak vanishing points, and so on.</p>
<p>There are a number of cool implications of this. For example, the “least
patterned” regions of the horizon would correspond to regions that are “hard to
rationally approximate”; so, you’d expect them at plus-or-minus the golden
ratio’s slope from your line of sight.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>And some observations about the associativity of English affixes</p>


<p>Say what you will about <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>, it has its moments, and this is
one of my favorites (watch it to the end of the clip!):</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MsawieizDeE?start=210"
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope;
picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Putting aside the wonderful meta-dramatic irony of this moment, the word
“un-unravelable” is the kind of thing you can sit and think about for hours. I
know because I have.</p>
<p>See, you might think that the “un-“ prefixes cancel, such that “un-unravelable”
means the same thing as “ravelable.” This is kind of like how
“un-unforgettable” probably means “ordinary.” And indeed, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/un-unravelable">Wiktionary
agrees</a> with this assessment,
suggesting instead “ravelable” as the “simpler and more immediately logical
choice.”</p>
<p>But clearly that’s not what Dr. Cooper meant in this case! “Ravelable” means
<em>can be raveled</em> whereas Dr. Cooper meant <em>cannot be unraveled</em>, which are at
least intuitively separate concepts. So what’s going on?</p>
<p>First of all, we need to figure out what “ravel” means: it
<a href="https://www.websters1913.com/words/Ravel">means</a> to entangle. Something that
is “raveled” is entangled and knotted like the HDMI cords behind your cable
box. The sleep that Macbeth murders is the “sleep that knits up the raveled
sleeve of care” (2.2.37). Actually, that’s not the full story. “Ravel” <em>also</em>
means to <em>disentangle</em>, making the word a so-called “Janus word” (read more at
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/words-own-opposites">Merriam-Webster</a>).
But let’s stick with the former definition for the moment.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we can start tacking on prefixes and suffixes. But we have to be
careful!  The dynamics of affixes are tricky — the order in which we tack
them on matters.</p>
<p>For example, “ravel-able” would mean <em>can be entangled,</em> so spaghetti is
ravelable. Then “un-ravelable” could mean <em>cannot be entangled,</em> so ravioli is
unravelable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, “un-ravel” would mean <em>to disentangle,</em> so Sherlock unravels
mysteries. Then “unravel-able” could mean <em>disentanglable,</em> so the mysteries
Sherlock solves are unravelable (by him, at least).</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>un+(ravel+able): there is <em>no</em> way to ravel it</li>
<li>(un+ravel)+able: there <em>is</em> a way to unravel it</li>
</ul>
<p>Alas! The associative property has broken down! This means we need to examine
each of the five possible paranthesisifications of “un+un+ravel+able”
separately (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number">why five?</a>).</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>(un+un)+(ravel+able)</strong> and</li>
<li><strong>((un+un)+ravel)+able</strong> are easy: neither of them typecheck, because
“un+un” is meaningless.</li>
<li><strong>un+(un+(ravel+able)):</strong> “ravelable” means <em>can be entangled,</em> so
“un-ravelable” means <em>cannot be entangled,</em> and thus “un-unravelable”
means <em>is not such that it cannot be entangled,</em> i.e. <em>can be
entangled.</em> For example, your new favorite organizational scheme might seem
perfect at first, but after a few weeks you will find that no scheme can
fend off the entropic tendencies of the universe, and that your files are by
nature un-un-ravelable.</li>
<li><strong>(un+(un+ravel))+able:</strong> “unravel” means <em>disentangle,</em> so “un-unravel”
means <em>re-entangle</em> (by analogy to “un-undo” meaning “redo”) and thus
“ununravel-able” means <em>re-entanglable.</em> For example, a jigsaw puzzle that
you mix up again after solving is ununravel-able.</li>
<li><strong>un+((un+ravel)+able):</strong> “unravel” means <em>disentangle,</em> so “unravel-able”
means <em>can be disentangled,</em> and thus “un-unravelable” means <em>cannot be
disentangled.</em> For example, Dr. Cooper’s web of lies is un-unravelable.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what’s really going on here is that the prefix <em>un-</em> has many faces (a Janus
prefix?); it reverses verbs and negates adjectives. Perhaps this is clearer in
the language of first-order logic, where <em>-able</em> introduces an existential
quantifier over <em>a way to do the thing</em> (and thus do(w, x) does w to x).</p>
<ol>
<li>N/A</li>
<li>N/A</li>
<li><strong>(un+(un+(ravel+able)))(x)</strong> means &not;&not;&exist;w. raveled(do(w, x))</li>
<li><strong>((un+(un+ravel))+able)(x)</strong> means &exist;w. &not;&not;raveled(do(w, x))</li>
<li><strong>(un+((un+ravel)+able))(x)</strong> means &not;&exist;w. &not;raveled(do(w, x))</li>
</ol>
<p>Only (5) puts an odd number of negations outside the existential quantifier,
flipping it to a universal quantifier, and expressing that you <em>cannot</em> unravel
whatever needs unraveling.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t this effect happen with “un-unforgettable”? It’s because “unforget”
isn’t a common word, and so we reach for interpretation (3) rather than (5).
Though now that I think about it, “unforget” is an excellent replacement for
“remember.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Words that do Handstands]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Dreaming ambigrams by gradient descent</p>


<p>The other day I ordered a book on art history from Amazon… which reminded me
of the movie <em>Angels and Demons</em>, which reminded me of ambigrams. Ambigrams are
those stylized words that look the same when you turn them upside down. Here is
the classic, <a href="http://www.johnlangdon.net/works/angels-demons/">by John
Langdon</a>.</p>
<p><img src="static/ambigrams/langdon.png" alt="earth air fire water"></p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about the absurd power of gradient descent these days,
and so almost immediately I felt the need to try and synthesize ambigrams
on-demand by gradient descent.</p>
<p>It turns out that this isn’t too hard to implement. Let’s start with just
single-character ambigrams. Here’s the plan: first, we train some sort of
neural net to recognize characters. This training is by gradient descent on the
weights / convolution filter / whatnot; specifically, we imagine a function of
the weights that outputs some loss and take its derivative <em>with respect to the
weights</em> to do gradient descent. Once the neural net is trained, however, we
can just treat it as a single function from tensors (input image) to tensors (a
one-hot encoding of the classification… or some softmaxed approximation).
Taking that one-hot output and converting it into a cross-entropy loss against
some desired output, we can now do gradient descent to minimize this loss <em>with
respect to the input image</em> (keeping the weights constant). This process lets
us “dream” of images representing whichever characters we want.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can do the same thing but with the tensor turned upside-down, to
dream images of upside-down characters. Okay, so now we can just combine these
two processes — literally, by adding the loss functions — to dream an image
that matches one character right-side-up and another character upside-down.
That’s it! Now we let it run all day to generate an image for each alphanumeric
character pair (36^2 = 1296) and we start to get a nice little “ambigram font”:</p>
<p><img src="static/ambigrams/grid.png" alt="grid"></p>
<p>Combining letters from this “font” lets us make arbitrary ambigrams.</p>
<p>This was a low-effort operation, hacked together over an evening and a morning,
plus a full day of “training.” I’m sure it’s possible to do better. Here are
some technical notes for anyone who wants to have a go at it. My code is all
online, <a href="https://github.com/kach/neural-ambigrams">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s all written in PyTorch. The neural net itself is literally PyTorch’s
built-in <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist">MNIST
example</a>.</li>
<li>I used the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/node/1298471/emnist-dataset">EMNIST</a>
dataset, which is MNIST that also adds in the alphabets from the NIST
database (and comes with PyTorch). I used the “balanced” split.</li>
<li>I added an L1 regularizer to force the output images to be sparse, i.e.
mostly “blank paper” with some “ink.” Without this, you get very dark images.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, now time for some pictures. Some turned out better than others, and there
is plenty of scope for improvement…</p>
<p>P.S. Depending on your browser, images in this post may or may not flip
upside-down automatically if you hover over them.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Buffering the Sock Stream]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>How much space do I need to do my laundry?</p>


<p>It’s the end of week 4 of the quarter and you’ve decided it’s finally time to
do some laundry. You somehow transport the massive mound of clothing in your
closet to the laundry room, occupy all three machines and also the dishwasher,
and finally transport the now-slightly-less-smelly mound of clothing back up
the stairs to your room. Then you turn on your favorite Pink Floyd album and
begin folding…</p>
<p>You pull out items of clothing from the heap one by one. Shirts and pants you
can fold immediately, but socks pose some difficulty: you can’t put them away
until they have been paired. So you put them aside on your bedside table to be
processed later. Soon, however, the pile of socks on your bedside table grows
too large, and the table can only fit so much sock on it.</p>
<p>So you decide to try and manage the situation by eagerly pairing up socks. If
you pull a sock out of the heap of clothes and see its partner on the bedside
table, you pair them up and put them away. Otherwise, you put the unpaired sock
on the bedside table.</p>
<p>Suppose you own an infinite number of socks, each of which is uniformly one of
($ k $) colors. How big does your bedside table need to be? Let’s call the pile
of clean clothes the “stream,” and the bedside table the “buffer.” Then the
question is, what is the distribution of the buffer size over time as a
function of ($ k $)?</p>
<p>Here is one way to think about this: if ($ k = 1 $) then the buffer size is 0
half the time and 1 half the time; the distribution is normal at mean 0.5 and
variance 0.25. For larger ($ k $), we can think of this as just a superposition
of multiple buffers, one for each ($ k $). The means and variances add, so we
expect the distribution to be normal with mean ($ k/2 $) and standard deviation
($ \sqrt{k}/2 $).</p>
<p>Here is another way to think about this: we have a Markov process where the
transition from state ($ i $) to ($ i + 1 $) is with probability ($ (k - i)/k
$) and to ($ i - 1 $) is with probability ($ i/k $) for ($ 0 \leq i \leq k $).
We can create a matrix representing this transition system; then, eigenvectors
of this matrix (with eigenvalue 1, and normalized to sum 1) represent
equilibrium probability distributions.</p>
<p>So, incredibly, we’ve shown that the coordinates of the ($ \lambda=1 $)
eigenvector for this matrix can be computed using the normal CDF. What a
fascinating correspondence!</p>
<p>If you don’t believe it, the graph below shows the normal-CDF predictions
(orange line) and the elements of the eigenvector (blue dots) for ($ k = 100
$). The IPython notebook that generated this graph is

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Some fast recreational physics</p>


<p>Quick back-of-the-envelope analysis of a windmill, just for fun.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.wind-watch.org/faq-size.php">National Wind Watch</a> a
typical windmill is a GE 1.5-megawatt model which has 116-ft blades.</p>
<p>Let’s say the wind speed is ($ v $), which is typically 10-15 m/s on a good
day. Then in time ($ t $) the volume of air that passes across the windmill is
a cylinder of height ($ tv $) and area ($ \pi r^2$). Air’s density, ($ \rho $),
is around 1.225 kilograms per cubic meter. This gives a total mass of ($ M =
\rho tv\pi r^2 $). Taking ($ v $) to be a modest 10 m/s, this works out to 48
metric <em>tons</em> of air per <em>second</em>.</p>
<p>Now let’s apply conservation of energy on this mass of air. Initial energy is
($ Mv^2 / 2 $) and final energy is ($ Mw^2/2 $), and the difference is on the
order of the energy output, which is a function of the power output and ($ t $)
assuming reasonable efficiency in the turbine.</p>
<p>So, we have ($ \rho tv\pi r^2 v^2 / 2 - \rho tv\pi r^2 w^2 /2 = Pt $). Time
cancels, which is comforting since this is a continuous process. The equation
that’s left suggests that power output of a windmill is proportional to the
<em>cube</em> of the wind speed!</p>
<p>Another thing to think about is how much the wind slows down by. Solving for ($
w $) and taking ($ P $) to be 1.5 MW, we have ($ w = \sqrt{ \frac{2P/\rho \pi
r^2 - v^3 }{-v}} $). For 15 m/s winds, this means wind slows down by around 10%
because of the windmill.</p>
<p>Actually this wasn’t “just for fun,” it was to show off initial progress on my
side-project. :-)</p>
<p><img src="static/windmill-math.png" alt="screenshot"></p>
<p>Oh, and an unresolved question: because air is coming into the windmill faster
than it’s going out, the momentum flux across the plane of the windmill is net
negative.  Applying Gauss’ law, we would expect a buildup of air in the
windmill, which obviously doesn’t happen. What’s wrong?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>An analytical analysis of an anomalous advertisement</p>


<p>I was in Los Angeles over winter break, and on the long drive back home I began
thinking about a billboard I saw just at the edge of the city advertising the
<strong>“closest casino to anywhere in LA.”</strong></p>
<p>This is a fascinating claim. Let me rephrase it, at least the way I interpret
it: the claim is that <em>wherever</em> you are in LA, the closest casino is the one
advertised on the billboard. (This is confusingly distinct from the claim that
the casino is closest to <em>anywhere</em> in LA, in the sense that the placement of
the casino minimizes the distance to the nearest bit of LA soil. Of course,
practically speaking this latter claim is useless because any casino <em>within</em>
LA trivially has the minimal distance of zero to “anywhere in LA.”)</p>
<p>The question is this: what region does the billboard’s claim imply is devoid of
casinos?</p>
<p>Let’s start with a simple case to get some intuition. Suppose LA is a
15-mile-radius disk, and the casino is at the center of the disk. Then,
according to the billboard, there must be <em>no</em> other casinos within LA’s
15-mile radius (otherwise, if you were in LA, you <em>might</em> be closer to that
other casino!). But actually, the claim is quite a bit stronger: there cannot
be any casinos within <em>thirty</em> miles of the center. Why? Well, suppose there
was a casino 20 miles from the center of LA. Then, someone just within the city
borders would be 5 miles away from that <em>other</em> casino, but 15 miles from the
city-center casino.</p>
<p>One more simple case: suppose LA is a line segment of length 15 miles, and the
casino is located at one endpoint. Can you imagine what the region in question
must be? It is a disk of radius 15 miles, centered at the <em>other</em> endpoint!
This is not entirely obvious, and you might need to draw a picture to convince
yourself that this is true.</p>
<p>Now let’s consider a much trickier case: suppose LA is a circle again, but the
casino is located along the <em>circumference</em>. Suddenly, it’s <em>much</em> harder to
picture what’s going on — sitting in a car without pencil or paper, I had no
idea what the region might look like. My instinct was “circle centered at the
diametrically-opposite point on the circumference,” but it turns out that this
is <em>wrong!</em></p>
<p>In the rest of this post, we’ll build up some mathematical machinery to answer
this question correctly. If you don’t want to work through the math, however,
then feel free to just scroll to the red-bordered squares and enjoy the
interactive demos.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Given some region ($ R \subset \mathbb{R}^2 $), the <em>casino
closure</em> with respect to some point ($ p \in \mathbb{R}^2 $) is defined as</p>
<p>\[
R^p = \left\{
  c \in \mathbb{R}^2 ~\middle|~
  \exists z \in R, || p - z || &gt; || c - z ||
\right\}
\]</p>
<p>Or, informally: the casino closure is the set of <em>possible casino locations</em> ($
c $) such that there exists a person ($ z $) in the region ($ R $) who is
closer to ($ c $) than to ($ p $).</p>
<p>From here on out, I’m only going to worry about “nice” regions, i.e. closed,
connected regions with smooth boundaries. I’m also going to use ($ x, p, z, c
$) to range over points in ($ \mathbb{R}^2 $), but really most math that
follows is equally applicable in ($ \mathbb{R}^n $). It’s just harder to
visualize.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> Let the disk ($ D(z, r) $) be the set of all points in ($
\mathbb{R}^2 $) within ($ r $) of point ($ z $). Then,
\[
R^p = \bigcup_{z~\in~R} D(z, ||p - z||)
\]</p>
<p>That is, we can construct ($ R^p $) by combining all the disks at all the
points in ($ R $) that have ($ p $) on their circumference.</p>
<p><strong>Proof sketch.</strong> This should make sense “by construction.” If point ($ c $) is
in this constructed ($ R^p $), then it lies in some disk ($ d $), and thus the
point ($ z \in R $) that created disk ($ d $) fulfills the existence criterion
of our definition.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> If region ($ R $) has a boundary ($ B \subset R $), then ($
B^p = R^p $).</p>
<p><strong>Proof sketch.</strong> Clearly, ($ B^p \subset R^p $) if you believe the first lemma
— adding more points to ($ B $) should only increase the union of disks.</p>
<p>The harder direction to show is ($ R^p \subset B^p $). Consider some point ($ z
\in R$). Extend the ray ($ \overrightarrow{pz} $) until it intersects with ($ B
$) at point ($ z^\prime $). Then, we can relate the disks created by ($ z $)
and ($ z^\prime $): ($ D(z, ||p-z||) \subset D(z^\prime, ||p-z^\prime||) $).
Why? Because the disk from ($ z $) is smaller and internally tangent to the
disk from ($ z^\prime $).</p>
<p>Mapping this argument over the entire union, it makes sense that ($ R^p \subset
B^p $).</p>
<p>Okay, time for some empirical verification of all this theory. Try drawing the
boundary of a region (in black) here! The disks will show up in red. Notice how
filling in your region with black dots doesn’t change the red blob at all.

<hr>
<p>The boundary-circle lemma gives us a nicer characterization of ($ R^p $): it is
the region bounded by the curve that is tangent to all of the disks created by
the points on ($ B $). It turns out that there is a very nice mathematical
theory of “the curve that is tangent to all curves in a given family of
curves,” and that is the theory of <em>envelopes</em>. The account below is
paraphrased from <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3617131?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">“What is an
Envelope?”</a>,
a lovely 1981 paper.</p>
<p>Let the function ($ F(x, t) : \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow
\mathbb{R} $) define a family of curves parameterized by ($ t $), in the sense
that ($ F(x, 0) = 0 $) defines a curve and ($ F(x, 1) = 0 $) defines another
curve, and so on. Then, we seek to characterize the envelope curve which is
tangent to every curve in ($ F $).</p>
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> If the boundary of ($ R $) can be (periodically) parameterized as ($
B(t), t \in \mathbb{R} $) then the boundary of ($ R^p $) is the <em>envelope</em> with
respect to ($ t $) of
\[
F(x, t) = || x - B(t) ||^2 - || p - B(t) ||^2
\]</p>
<p><strong>Proof sketch.</strong> Again, this should make sense “by construction”: ($ F $) is
chosen to correspond to circles centered at ($ B(t) $) passing through ($ p $).</p>
<hr>
<p>Ah, but how do we find the envelope? Here we need a tiny bit of multivariable
calculus.</p>
<p>Let ($ X(t) $) be the parameterization of the envelope of ($ F $). Then for all
($ t $), we have that ($ F(X(t), t) = 0 $) because the envelope must lie on the
respective curve in the family (“tangent” means “touch”!). We also have that
the curve ($ X(t) $) must be parallel to the member of family ($ F $) at ($ t
$). We can then express this condition by saying that the gradient (with
respect to ($ X $)) of ($ F $) at ($ t $) is perpendicular to the derivative of
($ X $) at ($ t $). Or:</p>
<p>\[
d X(t) / dt    \cdot    \nabla_X F(X(t), t) = 0
\]</p>
<p>In two dimensions, with ($ X(t) = (x(t), y(t)) $), this equation manifests
itself as ($ x^\prime(t)\partial F(x, y, t) / \partial x + y^\prime(t)\partial
F(x, y, t) / \partial y $).</p>
<p>The left hand side is oddly reminiscent of the multivariable chain rule.
Indeed, if we took the partial derivative of our equation ($ F(X(t), t) = 0 $)
with respect to ($ t $), we would get:</p>
<p>\[
dF(X, t)/dt = dX/dt\cdot\nabla_X F(X, t) + dt/dt\cdot \partial F(X, t)/\partial t = 0
\]</p>
<p>So we must have ($ \partial F(X, t) / \partial t = 0$).</p>
<p>There is a simpler but less rigorous derivation if you believe that the
envelope is exactly the points of intersection of infinitesimally close curves
in the family ($ F $). Then we want every point ($ X $) on the envelope to
satisfy both ($ F(X, t) $) and ($ F(X, t + \delta) $) for some ($ t $) and some
infinitesimal ($ \delta $). Taking the limit as ($ \delta $) approaches zero
gives the same condition that ($ \partial F(X, t) / \partial t = 0 $). The
paper above discusses how this notion is subtly different in some strange
cases, but it suffices to say that for all “nice” ($ R $), we’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>Almost-a-theorem.</strong> The boundary of ($ R^p $) is given by the parameterized
vectors ($ X $) that satisfy ($ F(X, t) = 0 $) and ($ \partial F (X, t) /
\partial t = 0 $) for the ($ F $) defined above.</p>
<p><strong>Almost-a-proof-sketch.</strong> Almost! In general, the solution for ($ X $) might
self-intersect, so we want to take only the “outermost” part of ($ X $). But
this is easy to work out on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> Suppose ($ R $) is the unit disk centered at ($ (a, 0) $), and ($
p $) is located at the origin. Then ($ B(t) = (\cos t + a, \sin t) $) and ($ p
= (0, 0) $). We have</p>
<p>\[
F((x, y), t) =
  ((x - (\cos t + a))^2 + (y - \sin t)^2) - ((\cos t + a)^2 + \sin^2 t)
\]</p>
<p>\[
F((x, y), t) = -2ax + x^2 - 2x\cos t + y^2 - 2y \sin t = 0
\]</p>
<p>We also have</p>
<p>\[
\partial F((x, y), t) / \partial t = 2x\sin t - 2y\cos t = 0
\]</p>
<p>Solving these by eliminating ($ t $) is a simple exercise in polar coordinates.
Discover from the second equation that ($ t = \theta $), then recall that ($
r^2 = x^2 + y^2 $). The resulting boundary of ($ R^p $) is (almost!) the curve
($ r = 2(1 + a\cos\theta) $). In other words, it’s (almost!) a limaçon! As ($ a
$) varies, the character of the limaçon varies, and at the critical points ($ a
= \pm 1 $), we get a cardioid with a cusp. Beyond those critical points, the
curve has an inner loop that we have to ignore; hence, “almost!”</p>
<p>Okay, time for more empiricism. Move your mouse around in the square below to
see how the relative placement of LA and the casino affects the envelope.
Notice also the inner loop predicted by the envelope, which we should of course
ignore for the purposes of bounding ($ R^p $).</p>
<canvas id="world-cardioid" width=300 height=300 style="border: 1px solid red;"></canvas>

<p>An amazing fact is that a cardioid is the same shape you get on the surface of
your coffee mug when you put it under a light! Well, not quite — it depends
subtly on where the light source is. Read more about caustics at

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A Markovian adventure in optimizing historical typewriter layouts</p>


<p>I recently read this <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/chinese-computers/504851/">Atlantic
piece</a>
on input methods for computers, and it reminded me of a mathematical adventure
I had this summer that I should have blogged about at the time.</p>
<p>Back in July, I was exploring the City Museum of New York when I came across
this lovely Crown typewriter from the late 1800s. By our modern standards, it
uses a rather clunky input mechanism: you manually shift the pointer to the
character you want to type, press the button, rinse, repeat.</p>
<p><img src="static/crown-typewriter/crown-typewriter.png" alt="Crown Typewriter"></p>
<p>“What a waste of time,” you say. Ah, but even in the late 19th centure time was
the essential ingredient, and in the modern world there was no time. Notice,
then, that the designers of the Crown typewriter did not place the letters in
alphabetical order. Instead, the they placed commonly-together letters near
each other. You can type “AND” and “THE” rather quickly with just 2 shifts
apiece; “GIG,” on the other hand, takes 15 shifts from the G to the I, and 15
shifts back to the G.</p>
<p>The question, then, begs to be asked: is this the <em>most efficient</em> permutation
of letters? For example, Q and U are on opposite ends of the typewriter; surely
it would be better to put them together?</p>
<p>I have a doubly disappointing answer to this question: first, this is <em>not</em> the
most efficient permutation of letters (based on my digraph frequency map), but
I also don’t <em>know</em> what the most efficient permutation is! That is, I’ve found
permutations that are more efficient, but cannot prove that they are optimal
— after all, exploring all 26-factorial permutations is not an option.</p>
<p>My “cost” metric here is defined as “Ignoring non-alphabetic characters, how
many shifts does it take to type all of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> followed by all
of <em>The Time Traveller</em> followed by all of <em>The Adventures of Sherlock
Holmes</em>?” (All three are classic 19th-century novels available from Project
Gutenberg.)</p>
<p>By this metric, the naive alphabetical order (<code>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</code>)
requires a whopping 9,630,941 shifts. In comparison, the Crown Typewriter
(<code>XQKGBPMCOFLANDTHERISUWYJVZ</code>) requires only 6,283,692 shifts. But the
ComfortablyNumbered typewriter (<code>ZKVGWCDNIAHTESROLUMFYBPXJQ</code>) requires a mere
5,499,341 shifts. This means we can save nearly one in eight shifts from the
Crown typewriter!</p>
<p>I found this permutation with the following algorithm: start with a random
permutation, then “optimize” it by repeatedly swapping characters such that the
post-swap permutation has a lower cost than the pre-swap permutation. Continue
“optimizing” until no further swaps can be made. Now, do this procedure for a
large number of random starting permutations, and pick the lowest-cost
optimized permutation.</p>
<p>Encouragingly, it turns out that many different random starts get optimized to
my solution. What do I mean by that? Well, the graph below shows two datasets:
the costs of 1,000 random permutations and the costs of those permutations once
optimized. Clearly, optimization is doing great good.</p>
<p><img src="static/crown-typewriter/typewriter-graph-1.png" alt="First graph"></p>
<p>But let’s zoom in on the optimized permutations. Notice that the two
lowest-cost bars are almost an order of magnitude more frequent than the
remaining bars. In fact, the lower-cost bar’s “bucket” in the histogram is
populated <em>only</em> with permutations of cost 5499341! This suggests that 5499341
is a “hard ceiling” for my optimizer, rather than the furthest point on the tip
of a long tail that my optimizer samples from.</p>
<p><img src="static/crown-typewriter/typewriter-graph-2.png" alt="Second graph"></p>
<p>Of course, this is no proof: there might be a single highly-efficient
permutation that is hard to reach by optimizing a random permutation. But that
<em>feels</em> unlikely!</p>
<p>So: I leave this as an open problem for readers to explore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update (Dec 15): I found this <a href="https://yurichev.com/blog/cabling_Z3/">blog
post</a> by Dennis Yurichev that tackles
the same problem, but restated as “in what order do I mount these devices on
a rack if I want to minimize the total length of cables between them”? Dennis
finds an optimal solution for 8 devices with Z3… perhaps the solution
scales to 26 “devices”? Intriguingly, his post was published just weeks
before my visit to the City Museum!</p>
<p>Update (Jan 28): @rjp on Github has posted a <a href="http://rjp.is/blogging/posts/2019/01/linear-typewriters/">blog
post</a> with
<em>several</em> new approaches to this problem!</p>

<p><strong>Let’s play a game</strong>, shall we?</p>
<p>Pick a number. Not too large, though! You’re about to do some quick math on it.
(I’ll play along with 4.)</p>
<p>Okay. Ready? Good.</p>
<p>Now take your number and square it. (4 squared is 16.) Then, add your original
number to the square. (16 plus 4 is 20.) Finally, add forty-one. (20 plus 41 is
61.)</p>
<p>And now – your result – is it prime? Ha! I thought so. (61 certainly is.)</p>
<p>This little trick is due to Euler, who pointed out in 1772 that the polynomial
($ f(x) = x^2 + x + 41$) returns prime numbers for small integers — indeed,
all nonnegative integers up to and including 39. Since then, the quest for
other such “prime-generating” polynomials has fascinated number theorists from
around the world. As a little exercise, you may try convincing yourself that
there is no <em>perfect</em> prime-generating polynomial; that is, that there will
always be at least one integer input that gives a composite output.</p>
<p>But I digress. Here is what matters: The integers ($ x $) for which ($ f(x) $)
is composite are the deviants, the rebels, the ones who refuse to play along
with Euler’s little game.</p>
<p>Forty is the first such integer.</p>
<p>One hundred fifty-nine is another.</p>
<p>Welcome to the 159th Carnival of Mathematics.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Carnival always has a special place in its heart for clever ways to teach
children various math concepts. And this one’s no exception. In <a href="http://mathmisery.com/wp/2018/06/14/set-theory-for-second-grade/">Set Theory for
Second
Grade</a>, Manan
talks about how he designed an engaging lesson on set theory (and common
multiples!) for second graders. A quote from his students: “Can you hang this
in the hall so that everyone can see the college math we did?” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What an amazing moment — new symbols, new concepts, no problems! At this
point, I made sure to remind them that what they are learning right now is no
different from what I would teach in college. And that if today, here in
second grade they could do college math, then in third grade they can do
third grade math, in fourth grade they can do fourth grade math, and that
they can always do math! More than a few students’ faces lit up.</p>

4</a>,
Peter Cameron recounts in excellent detail the last couple days of the
Colloquium (it reads like a mini-Carnival!). Days 1 and 2 are linked within.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An induced subgraph of a graph is obtained by throwing away some vertices and
the edges incident with them; you are not allowed to throw away an edge
within the set of vertices you are keeping. Paul began with the general
problem: given a graph H, can you determine the structure of graphs G
containing no induced copy of H? … The answer is known in embarrassingly
few cases … Not even for a 4-cycle is the answer known!</p>

Pat Ballew begins with a fact that most high-schoolers are taught, and then
rather suddenly finds himself deep in a fascinating rabbit hole. (Editor’s
note: I encourage you to read the author’s <em>On This Day in Math</em> series; I
would list all thirty of the past month if I could…)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like many teachers at the upper level high school math classes, over the
years I’ve presented the sum of the Cubes of the natural numbers formula
above many dozens of times.  Then, perhaps like many others, I would point
out how nice it is that it turns out to be the square of the nth triangular
number, a happy coincidence that would make it easier to remember.  Usually
then, we would challenge them to extend the idea to fourth powers and see if
they could do the induction proof, even though there was no really nice
simplification (to my knowledge) of the sums of fourth powers.</p>
<p>But then I reread a book that has been in my library for about six years, and
realized that many of those teachers may have known a different approach to
sums of cubes equaling square of sums that I had been completely unaware of.
In case there are other teachers who somehow also didn’t know, I share my
newfound ancient knowledge.</p>

Reciprocity</a>,
Dan McQuillan gives a fast-paced overview of one of my personal favorite
theorems in number theory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mathematics, the way it is currently written, can be difficult to read.
Sometimes it helps to see how people think about a topic or theorem before
(or after, or during) the reading of a proper treatment or rigorous proof.
The purpose of this post is to provide such a view regarding the proof of the
famous law of quadratic reciprocity. There are many details missing, on
purpose, and the hope is that it reads like a good story that’s both
interesting, believable and easily verifiable.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A guest post for White Group Mathematics</p>


<p>Earlier this month, Frederick Koh, a Singaporean math tutor, invited me to
write a guest post for his <a href="http://www.whitegroupmaths.com">website</a>. Of course
I accepted — blogging is, after all, a conversation.</p>
<p>But what could I write about?</p>
<p>I spent the month of November on the lookout for an idea worth sharing, and
last week I found one. I follow a lot of math-educator blogs (blogging is,
after all, a conversation!), and one of my favorites is that of Dan Meyers.
Recently, Dan posted a rather provocatively-titled piece, “<a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2017/dismantling-the-privilege-of-the-mathematical-1/">Dismantling the
Privilege of the Mathematical
1%</a>“.
He makes the case that those with a mathematical education — those who are
mathematically <em>privileged</em> — those who make up the mathematical 1% — they
are the ones with the responsibility to define what mathematics <em>is</em>. Dan says,
eloquently as always, that “through our action or inaction we create systems
that preserve our status as the knowers and doers of mathematics.”</p>
<p>Dan’s post made me think deeply about where I myself fit into his spectrum: I’m
hardly one of the 1% — and certainly won’t graduate with a math degree —
but at the same time, I love math, both as an activity and as a set of truths.</p>
<p>And I realized that this gives <em>me</em> a privileged position, one where I can
comment on mathematical topics from a somewhat neutral perspective. I am
neither the person who barely scraped through high school calculus, nor the
person who skipped high school calculus because it was too easy. So, trapped
between “math people” and “not a math person people”, I wish to use this post
to explore what exactly creates this divide — or, rather, explore it in a way
slightly different from what you have probably heard a dozen times already.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is almost universally acknowledged that “education is good.” More education,
says society, will lead to a happier, more prosperous world. Educate everyone,
says society.</p>
<p>I agree, of course.</p>
<p>And yet, paradoxically, we are so attached to the notion that education —
college, in my case, grad school or high school for others — is a means to
distinguish oneself from one’s peers. A degree, we argue, makes us stand out in
both the workplace and in society. The more competitive the institution, the
more valuable the degree.</p>
<p>Less enthusiastically, I agree with this as well: reality forces me to concede
the point. Why else would college admissions be so competitive? Why else would
classes be graded on curves? Why else would we even have grades in the first
place? As disturbed as I am by it, society cares very much about my academic
performance, <em>especially</em> in relation to others.</p>
<p>And therein lies the rub. Reader, are these not contradictory notions? If the
purpose of an education for an individual is to separate him or her from the
general populace, then what follows is the absurd notion that universal
education is self-defeating: that the more people we educate, the less an
education is worth to the individual.</p>
<p>How does one reconcile this? Can education in the limit benefit both the
individual and the society? As an optimist, I wish it could. And in fact I
believe it <em>can</em>, but only if we rethink what education means to the
individual.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here is what I think. I believe that too often, we conceive education to be a
ladder that lifts us — above others, if we’re fast enough — rung by rung.
The more you climb, the higher you get.</p>
<p>But too often, we forget that you can also climb <em>down</em> a ladder. That an
education can also lower the arrogant to humility and place them alongside the
less privileged, on common ground. That education builds capacity for empathy
and communication, empowering the individual but also society at large to have
a dialogue. That this view resolves the paradox of the previous section,
because both individuals <em>and</em> society benefit from the capacity for having
that dialogue.</p>
<p>What do I mean by this? Let’s return to mathematics for a moment.</p>
<p>If you are reading this blog, you most likely have been at a gathering of
mathematicians at some point in your lives. It is quite a marvellous thing to
behold: a congregation of brilliant minds sharing ideas. Mathematics as a
community has its own folklore, its own in-jokes, and its own language. You
need only to glance at sites like <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community">The Art of Problem
Solving</a> or
<a href="http://www.mathmo.org/test/mathmotest.html">mathmo.org</a> to see this community
in all its glory.</p>
<p>I love it. There is charm to the way mathematicians celebrate their field,
unlike any other profession I have come across.</p>
<p>And yet, imagine being an outsider for a moment. Imagine being part of the
mathematical 99%. How would you feel if someone responded to a question of
yours with a grin, saying “left as an exercise to the reader”? Or if someone
made you use this <a href="http://www.danielallington.net/2016/09/the-latex-fetish/">weird software
package</a> with lots of
backslashes to write up your homework? Or if someone went off on a tangent
about why their coffee mug said “donut” on it? Or if someone makes an
arithmetic mistake and then says “it’s true in base 12” before you even notice
the error? Or if someone claimed a very unobvious-to-you solution was
“trivial”?</p>
<p>These phrases aren’t meant to be exclusionary. Some are common inside jokes.
Others are part of the mathematical vocabulary. The word “trivial,” after all,
has a very specific mathematical meaning — think of the “trivial group” with
one element, for example. I
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=trivial+site:hardmath123.github.io&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">use</a>
it all the time.</p>
<p>Yet to an outsider, they make the mathematical community seem simply
impenetrable. How am I ever going to understand all this? I can’t think that
fast!</p>
<p>“Math people” tend to be remarkably self-selecting, and I believe this is one
of the reasons why: there is a divide between the initiated and the
uninitiated, and far too few resources for the latter.</p>
<hr>
<p>Education, I believe, should be tasked with <em>bridging</em> this divide — rather
than exacerbating it as it does now. Education should give the 99% the
opportunity to join the magical world of mathematics, but education should
<em>also</em> show the 1% how to open up the world to new members. It should teach
students to write about mathematics, finding a middle ground between dense
manuscripts weighed down by Greek-letter jargon, and airy puff-pieces that
contain nothing of substance. Where will future Ian Stewarts, Martin Gardners,
and Brian Hayes come from? I myself would almost certainly be very firmly a
“not a math person” person were it not for an Ian Stewart book in my dad’s
bookshelf that taught me about Fermat’s Last Theorem and the Mandelbrot Set
when I was very young.</p>
<p>Education should also encourage the next generation of professors to move away
from lessons that consist of the copying of lecture notes onto a chalkboard,
and provide them with the tools they need to create engaging, interactive
lessons that appeal not only to those whom we believe are pre-ordained to be
mathematicians, but to artists, musicians, writers, and athletes. It should
teach students about the bigger picture of where their mathematics fits into
society, about who produces and who consumes mathematics, and why.</p>
<p>At the same time, it should explain to the mathematical 99% what exactly those
math people are on about all the time. It should teach them the mathematical
canon, help them learn the language, and help them discover the beauty that the
1% have already found.</p>
<p>Yes, such an education will produce a more diverse generation of
mathematicians, not only in terms of demographics, but also in terms of ways of
thinking. It will produce a generation that writes not only more effective
grant proposals, but also clearer papers. That’s what the individuals get out
of it.</p>
<p>But it will also inspire the mathematical community to rise up against the
tyrrany of Alice-gives-Bob-three-bananas standardized tests, to use their
passion for mathematics and their perception of its beauty to guide the
development of curriculums and lesson plans. Not to reject non-math-people as
heretics who refuse to see the light, but rather to see them as evidence of a
broken education system that failed to convey the beauty of mathematics.</p>
<p>To redefine mathematics to be the way <em>they</em> see it, because, whether or not
they realize it, the way the mathematical 1% sees mathematics — as the
pursuit of beautiful truth — is far from what the mathematical 99% sees it as
— the painfully rushed manipulation of symbols on a midterm. To <em>care</em>.</p>
<p>That’s what society gets out of it.</p>
