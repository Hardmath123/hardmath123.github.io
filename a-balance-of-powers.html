                <h2>A Balance of Powers</h2>
                <h4>Thursday, November 19, 2015 &middot; 5 min read</h4>
<p>Wikipedia has an amusing article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_coincidence">“mathematical
coincidence”</a>, where
they say that it’s a “coincidence” that ($ 2^{10} $) is very close to 1000
(it’s actually 1024). This is why it’s occasionally confusing whether you mean
1000 or 1024 bytes when you say
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobyte#Definitions_and_usage">“kilobyte”</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not sure whether this is something to get excited about, but you know what
we say about coincidence…</p>
<p><img src="static/coincidence.gif" alt="The universe is rarely so lazy."></p>
<p>Here are some fun facts to inspire today’s post:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>($ 2^{12864326} \approx 10^{3872548} $) <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2%5E12864326">to within
0.0001%</a>, which means it
begins with the digits “10000000…”.</p>
</li>
<li><p>($ 1337^{47168026} \approx \pi\cdot10^{147453447}$) <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1337%5E47168026">to within
0.00000001%</a>. It begins
with the digits “31415926…”.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The hex expansion of ($ e^{19709930078} $) is around 10 billion digits long,
and it begins with the digits <code>deadbeef...</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is definitely something going on here. It’s time to investigate!</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s go back to powers of two. It really comes down to the fact that we’re
trying to solve equations that look somewhat like this one</p>
<p>\[
2^{\alpha} = \delta10^{\beta}
\]</p>
<p>for integers, where we can make ($ \delta $) as close to 1 as we want.</p>
<p>It should feel intuitive to take logs of both sides at this point. So let’s go
ahead and do that:</p>
<p>\[
\alpha \ln(2) = \ln(\delta) + \beta\ln(10)
\]</p>
<p>Since ($ \delta $) is close to 1, its natural log is close to 0. So this
equation reduces to finding a very close <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_approximation">rational
approximations</a> of the
ratio of the natural logs of 2 and 10.</p>
<p>Rational approximation, also called <em>Diophantine</em> approximation, is the “art”
of finding rational numbers very close to real numbers. Since the rationals are
dense in the reals, we can find a rational number arbitrarily close to any real
number. The na&iuml;ve way to do this is to simply take the decimal expansion
to as many digits as we want. So, for example, we can find rational
approximations of pi such as 3/1, 31/10, 314/100, etc.</p>
<p>So, it follows that we can find arbitrarily precise rational approximations of
($ \ln(10) / \ln(2) $), which is what we’re looking for! The numerator gives
the power of 2 and the denominator gives the power of 10.</p>
<p>That ratio is around 3.321928094, so ($ 2^{3321928094} $) should be really
close to a power of 10, right?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2%5E3321928094">…wrong.</a> The power of
10 is spot-on, but our first digit is completely off. This is tragic! We’re
close, but not close enough.</p>
<p>How can we fix this?</p>
<p>We could add more digits, but eventually WolframAlpha stops doing those
calculations for us. (There’s a nice online calculator
<a href="http://www.ttmath.org/online_calculator">here</a> that seems to handle much
bigger problems, but loses precision eventually.)</p>
<p>The problem is that even though we’re close, we’re not close <em>enough</em>. Remember
that our worst-case scenario with the decimal-truncation strategy is that we’re
off by ($1/\beta$). That is, we have</p>
<p>\[
\left| \frac{\alpha}{\beta} - \frac{\ln(10)}{\ln(2)} \right| = \frac{1}{\beta}
\]</p>
<p>Rearranging this a little bit, we have:</p>
<p>\[
\alpha \ln(2) = \ln(2) + \beta\ln(10) 
\]</p>
<p>In other words, we have:</p>
<p>\[
2^\alpha = 2\times10^\beta
\]</p>
<p>We could be off by up to a factor of two! That means that even though our
rational approximation is getting closer, our first digit could still vary
pretty randomly.</p>
<p>What’s an easy fix here? We could start by rounding rather than truncating.
This means our worst-case scenario drops to ($ 1/(2\beta) $) (why?), which
corresponds to being off by up to a factor of the square root of two (around
1.4).</p>
<p>If we round the example above, we get ($ 2^{3321928095} $), which is
<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2%5E3321928095">better</a>. But
percent-error wise, we’re still doing <em>worse</em> than ($ 2^{10} $). We need to
take more drastic measures.</p>
<hr>
<p>It turns out that there is a way to find the <em>best</em> rational approximation of
a number for a given denominator. This is a beautiful field of number theory
that relates images like the one below to computing GCDs efficiently.</p>
<p><img src="static/ford-circle.png" alt="Ford circle, from Wikipedia Commons."></p>
<p>I’ll leave it to you to discover the math on your own, but the result we seek
is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet%27s_approximation_theorem">Dirichlet’s approximation
theorem</a>,
which states that we can always find a rational approximation which is within
($ 1/(\beta^2) $) of the target. In fact, there are an <em>infinite</em> number of
such rational approximations, which means ($ \beta $) can get as large as we
want (why?).</p>
<p>Since we have a ($ \beta^2 $) term in the denominator, the error decreases
<em>faster</em> than the denominator. This means we can get within ($ 2^{(1/\beta)}
$) of a power of 10. Since there’s a factor of ($ \beta $) in that expression,
we can make it as large as we want to get as close to a power of 10 as we want!
Win!</p>
<hr>
<p>How do we compute these best rational approximations? The trick is to express
our target number as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction#Best_rational_approximations">continued
fraction</a>,
and then to simplify those continued fractions.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to write code to do this quickly. WolframAlpha and Mathematica
come with a built-in function <code>Rationalize</code> that does exactly what we want.
With a little twiddling of the “delta” parameter, we <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Rationalize%5Bln%2810%29%2Fln%282%29%2C+%28log_2%281.00001%29%29%5E2%5D">can
get</a>
approximations within whatever interval we want, and they
<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2%5E254370">work</a>!</p>
<p>Pushing this gives us lovely results, like ($ 2^{44699994} $), which is around
($ 9.9999997\times10^{13456038} $), <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2%5E44699994">within
0.0000003%</a> of a power of
ten. Wonderful.</p>
<hr>
<p>The natural question to ask now is whether we can do <em>even</em> better. Can we get
an <em>arbitrary</em> sequence of digits at the beginning of the result? It turns out
we can. By manipulating Euclidean algorithm a bit, we can generate any
remainder, not necessarily one that is close to zero. Since the remainder
controls the first few digits, we need to find an approximation with error ($
\ln(\delta) $).</p>
<p>The trick is to use a “secondary” version of the Euclidean Algorithm where we
approximate ($ \ln(\delta) $) by adding together the errors of successively
more precise approximations.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. Suppose we compute a series of rational approximations of a
number and we get the following two rows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Numerator</th>
<th>Denominator</th>
<th style="text-align:right">Error</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>1</td>
<td style="text-align:right">0.0131</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>87</td>
<td style="text-align:right">0.0028</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Adding these two rows gives us a new row:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Numerator</th>
<th>Denominator</th>
<th style="text-align:right">Error</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>88</td>
<td style="text-align:right">0.0159</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>(Why does this work?)</p>
<p>This gives us an approximation with error 0.0159. We can keep doing this in a
method that resembles a cross between Gaussian elimination in matrices and the
Euclidean algorithm for integers, and get as close as we want to any target
“error”.</p>

<p>You can download a Python program I wrote to generate these expressions
<a href="static/power-approx.py">here</a>. It uses the lovely
<a href="http://mpmath.org"><code>mpmath</code></a> library. A sample session with it, used to
compute one of the examples above:</p>

<p>If you enjoyed that journey, here are some exploration questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens when your base is 2 and your radix is 16? Why?</li>
<li>How is this related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_orchard">Euclid’s
Orchard</a>? Does exploring
Euclid’s orchard give a natural way to prove Dirichlet’s approximation theorem?
As a hint, what principle is named after Dirichlet?</li>
