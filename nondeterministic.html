                <h2>Nondeterministic</h2>
                <h4>Tuesday, February 10, 2015 &middot; 2 min read</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote this post to inaugurate a friend’s blog a while back and decided to
preserve it here. Though dated February 2015, I added it to
<em>ComfortablyNumbered</em> in early October.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Communication. It’s what separates a painter from an artist and a performer
from a musician. It turns a mob into an army and a fight into a debate. It’s
what separates coexistence and civilization.</p>
<p>In the world of computer science, we have a fictitious creation called the
Nondeterministic Computer. The Nondeterministic Computer, given a problem,
tests every possible solution of the problem instantanteously, and reports the
correct answers. The Nondeterministic Computer, were it to be realized, would
revolutionize computer science, data science, protein folding research, and of
course cryptography.</p>
<p>Guess what? You have the functional equivalent of a Nondeterministic Computer
right now. You have, to put it lightly, millions of brilliant minds at your
disposal. Combined, you have millions of years of experience, instinct,
opinion, and innovation at your command.</p>
<p>Because just as wonderful as Nondeterministic Computing is Nondeterministic
<em>Communication</em>. Of perhaps the 2,000 people that will read this post in the
next couple of months, some will agree. Some will disagree. Some will be
affected by what I say, and some will make it a mission to prove me wrong. The
vast majority will ignore it, spending less than 5 seconds on the page, and
only skimming a few words.</p>
<p>For all practical purposes, I am running my thoughts through a vast
supercomputer and getting a decent representation of humanity’s views on them.
I can do this anonymously, and I can do this for free.</p>
<p>In the scientific and academic world, communication happens through papers.
Progress happens when Darwin must publish his research before Wallace, when
Einstein refutes Newton, when Watson and Crick race Franklin’s lab, when Shamir
writes a paper breaking a cryptosystem Merkle and Hellman thought was secure.</p>
<p>In the tech world, progress happens when someone—a high schooler, an employee
at a startup, or the creator of Linux—leaves a vitriolic comeback on a blog
post.</p>
<p>Blog posts are what truly reflect us: our opinions, our rants, our tutorials,
and our reviews document, piece by piece, the world we have created. And the
comments document what we think of it.</p>
<p>In other words: <em>you</em> are responsible for the canon in this world. For
perpetuating knowledge. For inciting discussion. For starting arguments. For
causing change.</p>
<p>So write! Write controversial things! Express unpopular opinions, and do so
vehemently! Hate on something everyone adores! Use strongly-worded phrases. Use
exclamation points. Make noise, be mean. Get harsh feedback, <em>it’s what you
want</em>.</p>
<p>Be wrong once in a while. Say stuff you’ll cringe at in a year (because, to be
honest, you’ll cringe at everything you wrote a year back). Do what it takes to
put your opinions out there, because <em>they matter</em>. As a culture, we’re
fallible, and someone needs to call us out on it.</p>
<p>Your words are elegant weapons; use them to create a more civilized age.</p>
<p>And don’t be afraid to put your thoughts through a nondeterminisic computer
just because it’ll reject 99.99% of them. That’s what nondeterministic
computers do.</p>

<p>(Speaking of which, I hope they write more on their seemingly-dead blog. They
have good things to say. Everyone does.)</p>
