<p>Say what you will about <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>, it has its moments, and this is
one of my favorites (watch it to the end of the clip!):</p>

<p>Putting aside the wonderful meta-dramatic irony of this moment, the word
“un-unravelable” is the kind of thing you can sit and think about for hours. I
know because I have.</p>
<p>See, you might think that the “un-“ prefixes cancel, such that “un-unravelable”
means the same thing as “ravelable.” This is kind of like how
“un-unforgettable” probably means “ordinary.” And indeed, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/un-unravelable">Wiktionary
agrees</a> with this assessment,
suggesting instead “ravelable” as the “simpler and more immediately logical
choice.”</p>
<p>But clearly that’s not what Dr. Cooper meant in this case! “Ravelable” means
<em>can be raveled</em> whereas Dr. Cooper meant <em>cannot be unraveled</em>, which are at
least intuitively separate concepts. So what’s going on?</p>
<p>First of all, we need to figure out what “ravel” means: it
<a href="https://www.websters1913.com/words/Ravel">means</a> to entangle. Something that
is “raveled” is entangled and knotted like the HDMI cords behind your cable
box. The sleep that Macbeth murders is the “sleep that knits up the raveled
sleeve of care” (2.2.37). Actually, that’s not the full story. “Ravel” <em>also</em>
means to <em>disentangle</em>, making the word a so-called “Janus word” (read more at
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/words-own-opposites">Merriam-Webster</a>).
But let’s stick with the former definition for the moment.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we can start tacking on prefixes and suffixes. But we have to be
careful!  The dynamics of affixes are tricky — the order in which we tack
them on matters.</p>
<p>For example, “ravel-able” would mean <em>can be entangled,</em> so spaghetti is
ravelable. Then “un-ravelable” could mean <em>cannot be entangled,</em> so ravioli is
unravelable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, “un-ravel” would mean <em>to disentangle,</em> so Sherlock unravels
mysteries. Then “unravel-able” could mean <em>disentanglable,</em> so the mysteries
Sherlock solves are unravelable (by him, at least).</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>un+(ravel+able): there is <em>no</em> way to ravel it</li>
<li>(un+ravel)+able: there <em>is</em> a way to unravel it</li>
</ul>
<p>Alas! The associative property has broken down! This means we need to examine
each of the five possible paranthesisifications of “un+un+ravel+able”
separately (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number">why five?</a>).</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>(un+un)+(ravel+able)</strong> and</li>
<li><strong>((un+un)+ravel)+able</strong> are easy: neither of them typecheck, because
“un+un” is meaningless.</li>
<li><strong>un+(un+(ravel+able)):</strong> “ravelable” means <em>can be entangled,</em> so
“un-ravelable” means <em>cannot be entangled,</em> and thus “un-unravelable”
means <em>is not such that it cannot be entangled,</em> i.e. <em>can be
entangled.</em> For example, your new favorite organizational scheme might seem
perfect at first, but after a few weeks you will find that no scheme can
fend off the entropic tendencies of the universe, and that your files are by
nature un-un-ravelable.</li>
<li><strong>(un+(un+ravel))+able:</strong> “unravel” means <em>disentangle,</em> so “un-unravel”
means <em>re-entangle</em> (by analogy to “un-undo” meaning “redo”) and thus
“ununravel-able” means <em>re-entanglable.</em> For example, a jigsaw puzzle that
you mix up again after solving is ununravel-able.</li>
<li><strong>un+((un+ravel)+able):</strong> “unravel” means <em>disentangle,</em> so “unravel-able”
means <em>can be disentangled,</em> and thus “un-unravelable” means <em>cannot be
disentangled.</em> For example, Dr. Cooper’s web of lies is un-unravelable.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what’s really going on here is that the prefix <em>un-</em> has many faces (a Janus
prefix?); it reverses verbs and negates adjectives. Perhaps this is clearer in
the language of first-order logic, where <em>-able</em> introduces an existential
quantifier over <em>a way to do the thing</em> (and thus do(w, x) does w to x).</p>
<ol>
<li>N/A</li>
<li>N/A</li>
<li><strong>(un+(un+(ravel+able)))(x)</strong> means &not;&not;&exist;w. raveled(do(w, x))</li>
<li><strong>((un+(un+ravel))+able)(x)</strong> means &exist;w. &not;&not;raveled(do(w, x))</li>
<li><strong>(un+((un+ravel)+able))(x)</strong> means &not;&exist;w. &not;raveled(do(w, x))</li>
</ol>
<p>Only (5) puts an odd number of negations outside the existential quantifier,
flipping it to a universal quantifier, and expressing that you <em>cannot</em> unravel
whatever needs unraveling.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t this effect happen with “un-unforgettable”? It’s because “unforget”
isn’t a common word, and so we reach for interpretation (3) rather than (5).
Though now that I think about it, “unforget” is an excellent replacement for
“remember.”</p>
