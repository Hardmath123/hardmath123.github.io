If you want to take a boat from the Puget Sound to Lake Washington, you need to
go across the *Ballard Locks*, which separate the Pacific Ocean's saltwater
from the freshwater lakes. The locks are an artificial barrier, built in the
early 1900s to facilitate shipping.

Today, the locks have a secondary function: they are a picnic spot. A while
back, I visited the locks on a sunny and warm day. A band was playing in the
park by the water, and there were booths with lemonade and carnival games.
Every few minutes, a boat would enter the locks, be raised or lowered, and
continue on its way.

If you walk across the locks, you can check out the *fish ladder*, a series of
raised steps designed to help fish --- in this case, salmon --- migrate, since
the locks cut off their natural path between the water bodies. There is usually
a crowd around the fish ladder. Around once a minute, a salmon leaps out of the
water and goes up a step; the children gasp and cheer as they watch over the
railing.

This is the idyllic scene that we will soon destroy with the heavy hammer of
mathematical statistics. You see, it turns out that a little bit of thought
about these salmon can give us a way to use historical earthquake data to
approximate $ e $.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start at the beginning.

---

What is the probability that a fish jumps out of the water *right now?* This is
a tricky question to answer. Suppose there's a 10% chance that a fish jumps out
of the water right now. That means the probability that a fish *doesn't* jump
is 90%. In the next instant of time, there's again a 10% chance that the fish
jumps. So, the laws of probability tell us that over the course of $ n $
instants, there's a $ 0.90^n $ probability that *no* fish-jumps occur.

But there's an *infinite* number of instants in every second! Time is
continuous: you can subdivide it as much as you want. So the probability that
no fish-jumps occur in a one-second period is $ 0.90^\infty $, which is...
zero! Following this reasoning, a fish must jump *at least* every second. And
this is clearly a lie: empirically, the average time between fish-jumps is
closer to a minute.

Okay, so "probability that a fish jumps *right now*" is a slippery thing to
define. What can we do instead? Since the problem seems to be the "right now"
part of the definition, let's try to specify a time *interval* instead of an
*instant*. For example, what is the probability that we will observe $ n $
fish-jumps in the next $ t $ seconds?

Well, we're going to need some assumptions. For simplicity, I'm going to assume
from now on that fish jump independently, that is, if one fish jumps, then it
does not affect the behavior of any other fish. I don't know enough about
piscine psychology to know whether or not this is a valid assumption, but it
doesn't sound too far-fetched.

---

While we're on the subject of far-fetchedness: the math that follows is going
to involve a lot of handwaving and flying-by-the-seat-of-your-pants. We're
going to guess at functions, introduce constants whenever we feel like it,
evaluate things that may or may not converge, and, throwing caution and
continuity to the wind, take derivatives of things that might be better left
underived.

I think it's more fun this way.

Yes, we *could* take the time to formalize the ideas with lots of definitions
and theorems and whatnot. There's a lot to be said about mathematical rigor,
and it's really important for you, the reader, to be extremely skeptical of
anything I say. In fact, I *encourage* you to look for mistakes: the reasoning
I'm about to show you is entirely my own, and probably has some bugs here and
there. (The *conclusions*, for the record, match what various textbooks say;
they just derive them in a slightly different way.)

A couple of lemmas here and there might make the arguments here much more
convincing. But they will also make this post tedious and uninspiring, and I
don't want to go down that road. If you're curious, you can look up the gnarly
details in a book. Until then, well, we've got bigger fish to fry!

---

Okay, back to math. We can model the probability we're talking about with a
function that takes $ n $ and $ t $ as inputs and tells you the
probability, $ P(n, t) $, that you see $ n $ fish-jumps in the time period
$ t $. What are some things we know about $ P $?

Well, for starters, $ P(n, 0) = 0 $, since in *no* time, there's no way
anything can happen.

What about $ P(n, a + b) $? That's the probability that there are $ n $
fish-jumps in $ a + b $ seconds. We can decompose this based on how many of
the fish-jumps occurred in the "$ a $" and "$ b $" periods:

\begin{align}
P(n, a+b)   & = P(0, a)P(n, b) \\\\
            & + P(1, a)P(n-1, b) \\\\
            & + \\ldots \\\\
            & + P(n, a)P(0, b)
\end{align}

Hmm. This looks familiar... perhaps...

Yes! Isn't this what you do to the coefficients of polynomials when you
multiply them? The coefficient of $ x^n $ in $ a(x)b(x) $ is a similar
product, in terms of the coefficients of $ x^i $ and $ x^{n-i} $ in $ a(x)
$ and $ b(x) $, respectively.

This can't be a coincidence. In fact, it feels appropriate to break out this
gif again:

![Benedict Cumberbatch being awesome](static/coincidence.gif)

Let's try to force things into polynomial form and see what happens. Let $
p\_t(x) $ be a polynomial where the coefficient of $ x^n $ is the
probability that $ n $ fish-jumps occur in time $ t $:

\begin{align}
p\_t(x) &= P(0, t)x^0 + P(1, t)x^1 + \\ldots \\\\
        &= \\sum\_{n=0}^\\infty P(n, t)x^n
\end{align}

(Yes, fine, since $ n $ can be arbitrarily large, it's *technically* a "power
series", which is just an infinitely long polynomial. Even more technically,
it's a *generating function*.)

We know that $ p\_0(x) = 1 $, because nothing happens in no time, i.e. the
probability of zero fish-jumps is "1" and the probability of any other number
of fish-jumps is "0". So $ p\_0(x) = 1x^0 + 0x^1 + \ldots $, which is equal
to just "1".

What else do we know? It should make sense that $ p\_t(1) = 1 $, since if you
plug in "1", you just add up the coefficients of each term of the polynomial.
Since the coefficients are the probabilities, they have to add up to "1" as
well.

Now, taking a leap of faith, let's say that $ p\_{a+b}(x) = p\_a(x)p\_b(x) $,
because when the coefficients multiply, they work the same way as when we
decomposed the probabilities above.

Why is this property interesting,? We're turning a property about addition into
a property about multiplication. That sounds awfully like something *else*
we're used to:  logarithms!  Forgetting for a moment that $ p $ is a power
series, maybe we can "solve" for the function $ p\_t(x) $ by messing around
with something like this:

\\[
p\_t(x) = e^{tx}
\\]

Okay, $ e^{tx} $ doesn't quite work because we want $ p\_t(1) = 1 $. Maybe
$ e^{t(x-1)} $ will work? It seems to have all the properties we want...

---

Let's take a moment to stop and think. At this point, it's not even clear what
we're *doing*. The whole point of defining $ p\_t(x) $ was to look at the
coefficients, but when we "simplify" it into $ e^{t(x-1)} $ we no longer have
a power series.

Or do we?

Recall from calculus class that you can expand out some functions using their
*Taylor Series* approximation, which is a power series. In particular, you can
show using some Fancy Math that

\begin{align}
e^x &= \\frac{x^0}{0!} + \\frac{x^1}{1!} + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\ldots \\\\
    &= \\sum\_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}
\end{align}

If you haven't taken calculus class yet, I promise this isn't black magic. It's
not even plain magic. It's just a result of a clever observation about what
happens to $ e^x $ when you increase $ x $ by a little bit.

If you *have* taken calculus, bet you didn't think this "series approximation"
stuff would ever be useful! But it *is*, because a quick transformation gives
us the series representation for $ p\_t(x) $:

\\[
e^{t(x-1)} = e^{tx}/e^t = \\sum\_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(tx)^n}{n!e^t}
\\]

and so the coefficient of $ x^n $ gives us $ P(n, t) = t^n/(e^t n!) $.

---

Now we have a *new* problem: this formula doesn't depend *at all* on the type
of events we're observing. In particular, the formula doesn't "know" that the
salmon at Lake Washington jump around once a minute. We never told it! Fish at
*other* lakes might jump more or less frequently, but the formula gives the
same results. So the formula must be wrong. Sad.

But it might be salvageable! Let's go back and see if we can add a new constant
to represent the lake we're in. Perhaps we can call it $ \\lambda $, the
Greek letter "L" for lake. Where could we slip this constant in?

Our solution for $ p\_t(x) $ was:

\\[
p\_t(x) = e^{t(x-1)}
\\]

but in retrospect, the base $ e $ was pretty arbitrarily chosen. We could
make the base $ \\lambda $ instead of $ e $, but that would mess up the
Taylor Series, which only works with base $ e $. That would be inconvenient.

However, we know that we can "turn" $ e $ into any number by raising it to a
power, since $ e^{\\log b} = b $. If we want base $ b $, we can replace $
e $ with $ e^{\\log b} $. This suggests that $ \\lambda = \\log b $ could
work, making our equation:

\\[
p\_t(x) = \\left(e^\\lambda\\right)^{t(x-1)} = e^{(\\lambda t) (x-1)}
\\]

This seems to fit the properties we wanted above (you can check them if you
want). Going back to our Taylor Series expansion, we can just replace $ t $
with $ \\lambda t $ to get:

\\[
P(n, t) = \\frac{\\left(\\lambda t\\right)^n}{e^{\\lambda t} n!}
\\]

---

Let's step back and think about what we're claiming. Knowing *only* that fish
jump randomly, and roughly independently, we claim to have an expression for
the probability that $ n $ fish-jumps occur in a time interval $ t $.

"Okay, hold up," you say, "something smells fishy about this. This is pretty
bold: we know nothing about how fish think, or fluid dynamics, or whatever
other factors could influence a fish's decision to jump.  And yet we have this
scary-looking expression with $ e $ and a factorial in there!"

That's a fair point. I'm just as skeptical as you are. It would be good to back
up these claims with some data. Sadly, I *didn't* spend my time in Seattle
recording fish-jumping times. But, in a few more sections, I promise there will
be some empirical evidence to assuage your worries. Until then, let's press on,
and see what else we can say about fish.

---

We have a way to get the probability of some number of fish-jumps in some
amount of time. What's next?

One thing we can do is compute the *average* number of fish-jumps in that time
interval, using expected value. Recall that to find expected value, you
multiply the probabilities with the values. In this case, we want to find:

\\[
E\_t[n] = \\sum\_{n=0}^\\infty P(n, t)n
\\]

This looks hard... but also oddly familiar. Remember that

\\[
p\_t(x) = \\sum\_{n=0}^\\infty P(n, t)x^n
\\]

because, y'know, that's how we defined it. Using some more Fancy Math ("taking
the derivative"), this means that

\\[
\\frac{dp\_t(x)}{dx} = \\sum\_{n=0}^\\infty P(n, t)nx^{n-1}
\\]

and so $ E\_t[n] = p^\\prime\_t(1) $.

That... still looks hard. Derivatives of infinite sums are no fun. But remember
from the last section that we also have a *finite* way to represent $ p\_t(x)
$: what happens if we take *its* derivative?

\begin{align}
p\_t(x)         &= e^{(\\lambda t) (x-1)} \\\\
p^\\prime\_t(x) &= (\\lambda t)e^{(\\lambda t) (x-1)} \\\\
p^\\prime\_t(1) &= E\_t[n] = \\lambda t
\end{align}

Aha! The average number of fish-jumps in time $ t $ is $ \\lambda t $. If
$ t $ has units of time and $ \\lambda t $ has units of fish-jumps, this
means that $ \\lambda $ has units of fish-jumps-per-time. In other words, $
\\lambda $ is just the *rate* of fish-jumps in that particular lake! For Lake
Washington, $ \\lambda\_w = 1/60 \\approx 0.0167 $ fish-jumps-per-second,
which means that the probability of seeing two fish-jumps in the next thirty
seconds is:

\\[
p\_{30}(2) = \\frac{(0.0167\\times30)^2}{e^{0.0167\times30}2!} \\approx 0.076
\\]

I think that's pretty neat.

---

What about the *standard deviation* of the number of fish-jumps? That sounds
ambitious. But things have been working out pretty well so far, so let's go for
it.

*Standard deviation*, or $ \\sigma $, the Greek letter "sigma", is a measure
of "how far, on average, are we from the mean?" and as such seems easy to
define:

\\[
\\sigma = E[n-\\lambda t]
\\]

Well, this isn't hard to evaluate. Knowing that expected values add up, we can
do some quick math:

\begin{align}
\\sigma &= E[n] - E[\\lambda t] \\\\
        &= \\lambda t - \\lambda t = 0
\end{align}

Oops. We're *definitely* off by a *little bit* on average, so there's *no way*
that the standard deviation is 0. What went wrong?

Well, $ n - \\lambda t $ is negative if $ n $ is *lower* than expected!
When you add the negative values to the positive ones, they cancel out.

This is annoying. But there's an easy way to turn negative numbers positive: we
can square them. Let's try that.

\begin{align}
\\sigma^2 &= E[(n-\\lambda t)^2] \\\\
          &= E[n^2 - 2n\\lambda t + (\\lambda t)^2]
\end{align}

Now what? We don't know anything about how $ E[n^2] $ behaves.

Let's go back to how we figured out $ E[n] $ for inspiration. The big idea
was that

\\[
\\frac{dp\_t(x)}{dx} = \\sum\_{n=0}^\\infty P(n, t)nx^{n-1}
\\]

Hmm. What if we take another derivative?

\\[
\\frac{d^2p\_t(x)}{dx^2} = \\sum\_{n=0}^\\infty P(n, t)n(n-1)x^{n-2}
\\]

We get an $ n(n-1) $ term, which isn't *quite* $ n^2 $, but it's
degree-two. Let's roll with it. Following what we did last time,

\begin{align}
p\_t(x) &= e^{(\\lambda t)(x - 1)} \\\\
p^\\prime\_t(x) &= (\\lambda t)e^{(\\lambda t)(x - 1)} \\\\
p^{\\prime\\prime}\_t(x) &= (\\lambda t)(\\lambda t)e^{(\\lambda t)(x - 1)} \\\\
E[n(n-1)] &= p^{\\prime\\prime}\_t(1) \\\\
          &= (\\lambda t)^2
\end{align}

And now we have to do some sketchy algebra to make things work out:

\\begin{align}
\\sigma^2 &= E[(n-\\lambda t)^2] \\\\
          &= E[n^2 - 2n\\lambda t + (\\lambda t)^2] \\\\
          &= E[n^2 - n - 2n\\lambda t + n + (\\lambda t)^2] \\\\
          &= E[(n^2 - n) - 2n\\lambda t + n + (\\lambda t)^2] \\\\
          &= E[n^2 - n] - E[2n\\lambda t] + E[n] + E[(\\lambda t)^2] \\\\
          &= (\\lambda t)^2 - 2(\\lambda t)(\\lambda t) + \\lambda t + (\\lambda t)^2 \\\\
          &= \\lambda t
\\end{align}

...which means $ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\lambda t} $.

Seems like magic.

---

Okay, fine, we have this fancy function to model these very specific
probabilities about fish-jump-counts over time intervals. But the kids watching
the fish ladder don't care! They want to know what's *important:* "how long do
I need to wait until the next fish jumps?"

Little do they know, this question opens up a whole new can of worms...

Until now, we've been playing with $ n $ as our random variable, with  $ t
$ fixed. Now, we need to start exploring what happens if $ t $ is the random
variable. This needs some new ideas.

Let's start with an easier question to answer. What is the probability that you
need to wait longer than five minutes (300 seconds) to see a fish-jump? (Five
minutes is *way* longer than *my* attention span when looking at fish. But
whatever.)

It turns out that we already know how to answer that question. We know the
probability that *no* fish jump in five minutes: that's equal to $ p\_{300}(0)
$. Why? Well, when we plug in $ x = 0 $, all the $ x $ terms go away in
the series representation, and we're only left with (the coefficient of) the $
x^0 $ term, which is what we want.

Long story short, the probability that you need to wait longer than five
minutes is $ e^{0.0167\\times300(0-1)} = 0.00674 $. This means that the
probability that you *will* see a fish-jump in the next five minutes is $ 1 -
e^{0.0167\\times300(0-1)} $, which is around 0.9932. This is the probability
that you have to wait *less* than five minutes to see a fish-jump. For an
arbitrary time interval $ T $, we have $ P(t<T) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda T} $,
where $ t $ is the actual time you have to wait.

Sanity check time! This gets close to 1 as $ T $ gets higher, which sounds
about right: the longer you're willing to wait, the likelier it is that you'll
see a fish jump.  Similarly, if fish jump at a higher rate, $ \\lambda $ goes
up, and the probability gets closer to 1, which makes sense. Indeed,
encouragingly enough, this equation looks very close to the equation we use for
half-lives and exponential radioactive decay...

Now things are going to get a bit hairy. What is the probability that you have
to wait *exactly* $ T $, that is, $ P(t = T) $? This should be zero:
nothing happens in no time. But let's be reasonable: when we say "exactly" $
T $, we really mean a tiny window between, say, $ T $ and $ T + dT $ where
$ dt $ is a small amount of time, say, a millisecond.

The question then is, what is $ P(T < t < T + dt) $, which isn't too hard to
answer: it's just $ P(t < T + dt) - P(t < T) $, that is, you need to wait
*more* than $ T $ but *less* than $ T + dT $. In other words,

\\[
P(t \\approx T, dT) = P(t < T+dT) - P(t < T)
\\]

where $ dt $ is an "acceptable margin of error".

This looks *awfully* like a derivative! We're expressing the *change* in
probability as a function of *change* in time: if I wait $ dT $ longer, how
much likelier am I to see a fish-jump?

Let's rewrite our above equation to take advantage of the derivativey-ness of
this situation.

\begin{align}
P(t \\approx T, dT) &= \\left(\\frac{P(t < T+dT) - P(t < T)}{dT}\\right)dT\\\\
                    &= \\left(\\frac{d P(t < T)}{dT}\\right)dT \\\\
                    &= \\left(\\frac{d (1-e^{-\\lambda T})}{dT}\\right)dT \\\\
                    &= \\lambda e^{-\\lambda T} dT
\end{align}

By the way, this might give a simpler-but-slightly-less-satisfying answer to
our initial question, "what is the probability that a fish jumps out *right
now?*" If we set $ T $ to 0, then we get $ P(t \\approx 0, dT) = \\lambda dT
$. In other words, if fish jump out of the water at a rate $ \\lambda $,
then for a tiny period of time $ dT $, the probability of seeing a fish jump
in that time is $ \\lambda dT $. This is one of those facts that seems really
straightforward one day, and completely mindblowing the next day.

Anyway. Now that we have an approximation for the probability that you need to
wait a specific time $ T $, we can find an expected value for $ t $ by
taking the sum over discrete increments of $ dt $:

\\[
E[t] = \\sum^\\infty\_{k=0} P(t \\approx T, dT) \\times T
\\]

where $ T = k\\times dT $. Since we're talking about the limit as $ dT $
gets smaller and smaller, it seems reasonable to assume that this thing turns
into

\begin{align}
E[t] &= \\int^\\infty\_0 P(t \\approx T, dT) \\times T \\\\
     &= \\int^\\infty\_0 \\lambda e^{-\\lambda T} dT \\times T
\end{align}

You can integrate that by parts, or just use WolframAlpha, which tells you that
$ E[t] = \\lambda^{-1} $.

---

...which is kind of obvious, isn't it? Remember that $ \\lambda $ was the
rate at which our fish jumped. If fish jump once a minute, shouldn't we expect
to have to wait a minute to see a fish jump? Isn't this similar to the way
wavelength and frequency are related?

The answer is, "yes and no". "Yes", the value $ \\lambda^{-1} $ is indeed
pretty sensible in retrospect. A simpler way to derive it might have been to
note that for any time period $ T $, the expected number of fish-jumps is $
\\lambda T $ (as we found out above), and so the *average* time interval
*between* fish-jumps would be $ T / (\\lambda T) = \\lambda^{-1} $. The fact
that the average interval between fish-jumps corresponds to the the expected
interval is captured by the surprisingly well-known acronym "PASTA": Poisson
Arrivals See Time Averages (I'm not making this up!).

But "no", it's not "obvious" that you should have to *wait* the average
inter-fish time!

Suppose you, like Rip Van Winkle, you woke up after a very long sleep, and you
wanted to know "how much longer until Monday morning?"

Well, Monday mornings happen every 7 days, and so if you set $ \\lambda = 1/7
$, you should expect to have to wait 7 days until Monday.

But that's silly! You *definitely* need to wait fewer than 7 days on average!
In fact, most people would intuitively say that you need to wait 7/2 = 3.5 days
on average: and they would be right. (The intuition is that on average, you'd
wake up halfway between two Monday mornings.)

This is the so-called "Hitchhiker's Paradox": if cars on a highway through the
desert appear roughly once an hour, how long does a hitchhiker who just woke up
need to wait until he sees a car? It seems reasonable to say "half an hour",
since on average, you'd wake up halfway between two cars. On the other hand,
with $ \\lambda = 1 $, you'd expect to wait an hour until you see a car.

So which one is right? And why are the answers different?

Well, the "Rip Van Winkle" interpretation assumes that cars on a desert highway
--- like Mondays --- come at *regular* intervals. In reality, cars on a desert
highway --- like the salmon of Seattle --- are usually independent. They might
come in a cluster a few minutes after you wake up, or a lone car might come the
next day. Crucially, the next car doesn't "know" anything about previous cars,
and so it doesn't matter *when* you wake up: we call this property
"memorylessness".

It turns out that since there's a nonzero probability of having to wait a
*very* long time for a car, the average gets pulled up from half an hour. With
that in mind, it's really quite surprising that the true mean turns out to be
exactly $ 1/\\lambda $.

---

And now, the aftermath.

Very little of the above discussion was fish-specific. The only properties of
salmon that mattered here were that salmon jump randomly and independently of
each other, at some rate $ \\lambda $. But our calculations work for *any*
such process (let's call such processes *Poisson processes*).

Poisson processes were studied as early as 1711 by de Moivre, who came up with
the cool theorem about complex numbers. However, they're named after Siméon
Denis Poisson, who in 1837 studied (not fish, but) the number of wrongful
convictions in court cases.

Today, Poisson processes model all sorts of things. Managers use it to model
customers arriving at a grocery checkout. Programmers use it to model packets
coming into a network. Both of these are examples of *queueing theory*, wherein
Little's Law relates $ \\lambda $ to how long things have to wait in queues.
You could probably use a Poisson process to model how frequently bad things
happen to good people, and use that to create a statistical model of how unfair
the world is.

The upshot is this: even though I didn't record any fish-jumping data back in
Seattle, we can definitely try out these ideas on other "sporadic" processes.
Wikipedia, it turns out, maintains [a list of earthquakes that happened in the
21st century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_21st-century_earthquakes).
Earthquakes are pretty sporadic, so let's play with that dataset.

I [scraped](static/poisson/earthquakes.txt) the date of each earthquake, and
wrote a small [script](static/poisson/earthquakes.py) to count the the number
of earthquakes in each month-long interval. That is, $ t $ is 2,592,000
seconds. By "binning" my data by month, I got lots of samples of $ n $. This
gives an easy way to compute $ P(n, t) $ "empirically".

On the other hand, taking the total number of earthquakes and dividing by the
total time range (around 17 years, since we're in 2017) gives us the rate $
\\lambda $, which in this case works out to about $ 1.06\\times10^{-6} $
earthquakes per second. This gives a way to compute $ P(n, t) $
"theoretically" by using our fancy formula with the factorial and whatnot.

\\[
P(n, t) = \\frac{\\left(\\lambda t\\right)^n}{e^{\\lambda t} n!}
\\]

Comparing the results gives us this pretty plot!

![Earthquake poisson process](static/poisson/earthquakes.png)

They match up surprisingly well.

What else can we say? Well, the average inter-earthquake time works out to $
1/\\lambda $, or around 940,000 seconds. That's about eleven days. On average,
a reader of this blog post can expect to wait eleven days until the next
earthquake of magnitude 7 or above hits.

And for those of you who have been wondering, "can we do these calculations in
reverse to approximate $ e $?" the answer is, *yes!* We just solve the above
equation for $ e $.

\\[
e\\approx\\left(\\frac{P(n, t)n!}{(\\lambda t)^n}\\right)^{-(\\lambda t)^{-1}}
\\]

In my case, using earthquake data for $ n = 1 $, I got $ e \\approx 2.75 $.
I'd say that's pretty good for an algorithm that relies on *geology* for
accuracy (in reality, $ e $ is around 2.718).

---

In many ways, it is quite incredible that the Poisson process conditions ---
randomness, independence, constant rate --- are *all* you need to derive
conclusions for *any* Poisson process. Knowing roughly that customers at a
burger place are random, act independently, and arrive around once a minute at
lunchtime --- and knowing nothing else --- we can predict the probability that
four customers arrive in the next three minutes. And, magically, this
probability will have $ e $ and a factorial in it.

Humans don't evaluate expressions involving $ e $ and factorials when they
decide when to get a burger. They are subject to the immense complexity of
human life, much like how salmon are subject to the immense complexity of the
fluid mechanics that govern Lake Washington, much like how earthquakes are
subject to the immense complexity of plate tectonics.

And yet, somehow statistics unites these vastly different complexities, finding
order and meaning in what is otherwise little more than chaos.

Isn't that exciting?

**Postscript, two weeks later.** This morning at the coffee shop I realized
that the Poisson distribution is a lot like the binomial distribution with a
*lot* of trials: the idea is that you have lots of little increments of time,
and a fish either jumps or doesn't jump in each increment --- this is called a
Bernoulli process. Presumably, over a long period of time, this should even out
to a Poisson process...

Recall that the probability of a fish-jump happening in some small time period
$ dt $ turned out to be $ \lambda dt $ for our definition of $ \lambda $
as the *rate* of fish-jumps. Can we go the other way, and show that if the
probability of something happening is $ \lambda dt $ for a small period of
time $ dt $, then it happens at a rate of $ \lambda $?

Turns out, yes!

The *binomial distribution* is a way to figure out, say, what the probability
is that if I flip 100 counts, then exactly 29 of them land "heads" (a coin toss
is another example of a Bernoulli process). More abstractly, the binomial
distribution gives you the probability $ B(N, k) $ that if something has
probability $ p $ of happening, then it happens $ k $ times out of $ N $
trials.

The formula for $ B(N, k) $ can be derived pretty easily, and you can find
very good explanations in a lot of high-school textbooks. So, if you don't
mind, I'm just going to give it to you for the sake of brevity:

\\[
B(N, k) = \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}
\\]

Now, can we apply this to a Poisson process? Well, let's say $ k = n $, the
number of times our event happens in time $ t $. Then we have

\\[
\\binom{N}{n} p^n (1-p)^{N-n}
\\]

What next? We know that $ p = \lambda dt $. Also, for time period $ t $,
there are $ t / dt $ intervals of $ dt $, so $ N = t / dt $. That means
we can substitute $ dt = t / N $, and thus $ p = \lambda (t / N) $. This
gives us

\\[
\\binom{N}{n} (\lambda t / N)^n (1-\lambda t / N)^{N-n}
\\]

Oh, and of course to approximate a Poisson process, this is the limit as $ N
$ approaches infinity:

\\[
\\lim_{N\to\infty} \\binom{N}{n} (\lambda t / N)^n (1-\lambda t / N)^{N-n}
\\]

This isn't a hard limit to take if we break apart the product.

\\[
\\lim\_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{N! (\lambda t)^n}{n!(N-n)! N^n}
\\lim\_{N\\to\\infty}(1-\lambda (t / N))^{N-n}
\\]

The right half is surprisingly enough the definition of $ e^{-\\lambda t} $,
since the $ - n $ in the exponent doesn't really matter. The left half is
trickier: it turns out that $ N! / (N-n)! $ is the product $
N(N-1)\ldots(N-n+1) $. As a polynomial, it is degree $ n $, and the leading
term is $ N^n $. But look!  In the denominator, we have an $ N^n $ term as
well, so in the limit, those both go away.

We're left with what simplifies to our expression for the Poisson distribution.

\begin{align}
\\lim\_{dt\to 0} B(N=t/dt, p=\\lambda dt) &= \\frac{(\lambda t)^n}{n!}e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\
                                          &= \\frac{(\lambda t)^n}{e^{\\lambda t}n!} \\\\
                                          &= P(\\lambda, t)
\end{align}

which I think is literally magic.
