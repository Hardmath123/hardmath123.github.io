                <h2>Dancing Orchards on the I-5</h2>
                <h4>Tuesday, September 10, 2019 &middot; 3 min read</h4>
<p>The last time I spent a long time on I-5, I started thinking about
<a href="envelope.html">envelopes</a>. This time, I started thinking about orchards. As
you drive along the central valley highway, you can see thousands and thousands
of perfect rows of trees. You can actually see them from the top on Google’s
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@36.6590095,-120.643549,2656a,35y,236.91h/data=!3m1!1e3">satellite
imagery</a>;
try zooming in slowly on that point, it’s really quite beautiful.</p>
<p>When you drive by them, you see the side view rather than the top view. In
fact, you see the side view <em>in motion</em> – the trees look like they’re dancing
an elaborate dance, continuously lining up into different formations to form
different rows in different angles. Really, of course, it is you who is moving;
the trees are still but by viewing them from different angles you can see
different “alignments” of the grid.</p>
<p>The effect is most pronounced with freshly-planted trees (or perhaps those are
markers?), where there is no foliage blocking the horizon.</p>
<p><img src="static/orchard.png" alt="orchard"></p>
<p>I didn’t think to make a video at the time, but you can imagine that as the car
moves forwards a little bit, the pattern re-aligns in an incredibly satisfying
way.</p>
<p>I’m intrigued by the multiple “vanishing points” you can see in that picture.
The trees are regularly spaced in a square grid, but somehow there are multiple
(!) irregularly-spaced (!!) points along the horizon to which rows of trees
appear to converge. What’s going on here — is there a pattern to the
patterns? You could either stop reading here to have food for thought on your
next road trip, or you could keep reading for my ideas.</p>
<hr>
<p>The I-5 trees are a variation on a well-known theme: a theme called <em>Euclid’s
orchard</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_orchard">Wikipedia</a>,
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclidsOrchard.html">MathWorld</a>). You stand at
the origin of the plane, and at every integer point there is a line segment
(“tree”) extending one unit upwards perpendicular to the plane. What you see
from your vantage point is Euclid’s orchard. Try to imagine what it looks like;
then, play with a JavaScript simulation of it
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/euclids-orchard/5282060266635264">here</a>.</p>
<p>The main idea of Euclid’s orchard is that trees at integer points (x, y)
occlude trees at any integer multiples of that point (nx, ny), so you don’t see
anything behind them. Also, nearby trees appear taller than farther-away trees
because that’s how perspective works. So there is a “horizon” where in each
direction you either see (1) a tree if the direction’s slope is rational, and
the tree is shorter if its denominator is larger; (2) nothing if the
direction’s slope is irrational. All sorts of fun can be had with this: see for
example a <a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2017/07/22/a-few-words-about-pww-20/">nice connection to the Fibonacci
numbers</a>.</p>
<p>The I-5 orchard in the picture is similar, but now we look upon it from some
height. Imagine mapping each point on the horizon to the direction in which I
would have to point my camera to look directly at that point. The “vanishing
points” have lots of trees along those directions, giving the illusion of
“rows.” What does this mean? It means that if you walked along that ray in
Euclid’s orchard, you would run into trees more frequently than other rays. In
other words, those rays represent directions whose slopes are rational with
small denominators.</p>
<p>Hmm… rational with small denominators… where have I blogged about that
before…? Right — around four years ago, when we
<a href="a-balance-of-powers.html">showed</a> that 2^12864326 begins with the digits
“10000000…” (and other number-theoretic shenanigans).  I wasn’t kidding,
rational approximation really is one of my favorite topics!</p>
<p>At the time I showed you this picture with little explanation.</p>
<p><img src="static/ford-circle.png" alt="Ford circle"></p>
<p>Here is a little more explanation of its significance: as you start filling in
circles to some level, you generate a sequence of fractions called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence">“Farey
sequence”</a> by listing the points
of tangency of the circle and the X axis. The Farey sequence is the list of
completely reduced fractions whose denominators are smaller than some bound.
Putting those two facts together: the points of tangency of the circles
represent points that are “rational with small denominators” — exactly what
we thought our I-9 orchard’s “vanishing points” were!</p>
<p>Looking back at the image, this is somewhat believable. We see a couple of
“strong” vanishing points, and then “weaker” vanishing points in between the
strong ones, and then <em>even</em> “weaker” vanishing points between the strong and
the weak vanishing points, and so on.</p>
<p>There are a number of cool implications of this. For example, the “least
patterned” regions of the horizon would correspond to regions that are “hard to
rationally approximate”; so, you’d expect them at plus-or-minus the golden
ratio’s slope from your line of sight.</p>
