<p>To all the friends I made this summer. Thanks for all the memories.

<p>As with many exciting things, this one began with the prospect of bubble tea.</p>
<p>In case you’ve been missing out, bubble tea contains large tapioca pearls in it
and so it comes with extra-special straws that have twice the diameter of
normal straws.</p>
<p>Have you ever really thought about those straws? Of course you haven’t. I
applaud you and your sanity.</p>
<p>I, of course, <em>have</em> really thought about those straws. I occasionally say
things like “what if you tried to drink mercury through a meter-long straw?”,
which causes people to make excuses and leave, and TSA agents to make you take
your shoes off.*</p>
<p>But this being <em>my</em> blog, I’m now going to impose some thoughts about those
straws upon you. Brace yourself.</p>
<hr>
<p>See, the trouble is that you have to poke these straws through the top of your
drink. They have pointy tips to facilitate this, as kindly illustrated by the
very legit-looking website free-stock-illustration.com:</p>
<p><img src="static/bubble-tea-straw.jpg" alt="A picture of a straw."></p>
<p>Actually, anyone who’s ever poked a bendy straw through a juice box knows
exactly what I’m talking about. They have pointy tips, right? Right.</p>
<p>It turns out that you should be very concerned about this. Or not, if you’re
more of the “big picture” kind of person. Personally, I find this very
disturbing.</p>
<hr>
<p>What happens when you cut a straw? Well, a straw is a cylinder, so you should
get a cylindrical section. <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CylindricSection.html">Wolfram
Mathworld</a> reminds us that
planar slices of cylinders are ellipses:</p>
<p><img src="static/cylindrical-sections.gif" alt="Cylindrical sections"></p>
<p>But ellipses are not pointy. This is bad. Where does the pointiness come from?</p>
<p>If you ask someone, they’ll probably say things like “maybe it’s just a really
thin ellipse” or “maybe it’s actually not pointy and only cuts because the
plastic is very sharp”. So I guess it’s worth mentioning that (1) a thinner
ellipse would be just as blunt, and (2) if the plastic was that sharp, your
tongue would bleed each time you drank a Capri-Sun.</p>
<hr>
<p>I guess a more fundamental question to ask is, how are bubble tea straws cut?
This turns out to be surprisingly hard to find useful information on. <a href="http://www.madehow.com/Volume-4/Drinking-Straw.html">This
site</a> suggests some sort
of knifing mechanism. I envision a large-scale straw guillotine that chops up
hundreds of straws a minute and leaves a pile of straw-rubble on the factory
floor. (It turns out that <a href="http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/islandora/object/niu-lincoln%3A33791">straw
guillotine</a> is
a thing, and happens to be a thing in my Google search history now. Please
don’t judge me?)</p>
<p>In any case, the point (ha!) is that when you use a blade to cut a straw, you
momentarily flatten it. This is probably easiest to see if you pick up a straw
and try to cut it with scissors: the part right at the blade gets flattened the
way a garden hose does if you step on it.</p>
<p>So really, what we’re thinking about is, “what happens when you squish a
straw?”. I whipped up some images to help think about what’s happening (ping me
if you want the code).</p>
<p>This is what happens when you unsquish a cut straw (squishedness is on the Y
axis, different profiles are along the X axis):</p>
<p><img src="static/straw-pointy.png" alt="Pointy straws"></p>
<p>Yay, the rounded cylinder is pointy!</p>
<p>Depending on how traumatic your trigonometry class was, that curve in the
bottom right corner should look vaguely familiar. It’s half a period of a
sinusoid.</p>
<p>Can you convince yourself why this makes sense? Think about what the side
profile of a spring looks like…</p>
<hr>
<p>We knew that a planar slice wouldn’t form a straight-line cut because ellipses
aren’t pointy. So a natural question to ask is, what shape does a planar cut
correspond to?</p>
<p>Do you have a guess?</p>
<p><img src="static/straw-round.png" alt="Round straws"></p>
<p>Yep, it’s the inverse sine function (why?). Can you come up with a way to map
“squished” functions to “cylindrical” functions? Is this function invertible?
So many questions!</p>
<hr>
<p>To be honest, this post isn’t about straws—as interesting as they are. It’s
about looking around and finding exciting things. It’s about ignoring the
grown-ups who think straws are unexciting. Because we’re surrounded by exciting
things. Everywhere. Like happiness and magic and diatomic nitrogen. It’s <em>your</em>
job to go seek them out.</p>
<hr>
<p>(*But really, could you drink mercury out of a meter-high straw? Even if you
managed to suck out <em>all</em> the air in the straw, the vacuum would only manage to
hold up 76 centimeters of mercury… Gasparo Berti thought about this stuff in
the 1600s, and sent a letter to Galileo which got the ball rolling and led to
Torricelli proving the existence of a vacuum and inventing the barometer. <a href="http://articles.eklhad.net/tube">Read
