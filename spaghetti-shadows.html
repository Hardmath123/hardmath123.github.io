<p>Suppose you took a walk in a high-dimensional vector space, leaving behind
breadcrumbs. If you wanted to visualize your route, you might consider
projecting the breadcrumbs down to a lower-dimensional space.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to project the breadcrumbs onto three randomly-chosen
vectors. Then you might get something like this.</p>
<p><img src="static/spaghetti-shadows/spaghetti.png" alt="spaghetti"></p>
<p>But perhaps a better way to choose the projection is to do PCA on the
breadcrumbs as if they were any other point cloud. If you do this, you will
find that your walk was extremely loopy and spirally. Here’s an example of the
same trajectory, projected down to 3D with PCA (this data is taken from my
research work, but even a random walk will show the phenomena I discuss in this
post).</p>
<p><img src="static/spaghetti-shadows/loopy.png" alt="loops"></p>
<p>Looking at this, you might be concerned that you are walking in circles.</p>
<p>This, for example, was the situation with a <a href="https://icmlviz.github.io/icmlviz2016/assets/papers/24.pdf">2016 ICML
paper</a>,
“Visualizing Deep Network Training Trajectories,” that tried to visualize the
trajectory of neural network parameters over the course of training by doing
exactly what I described: PCA on “breadcrumb” snapshots of the parameters. The
author found some strange, hard-to-explain oscillatory behavior; even Lissajous
curves.</p>
<p><img src="static/spaghetti-shadows/nn.png" alt="loops with NNs"></p>
<p>A similar thing, by the way, happened with a 1994 text on genetics, “The
History and Geography of Human Genes” by Cavalli-Sforza et al, which applied
PCA to genetic data and found periodic effects.</p>
<p>It turns out however that there’s something deeper going on here, something
independent of the individual datasets: these loopy patterns seem to be “just
what happens” when you do PCA on such data. A <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08805.pdf">2018 NeurIPS
paper</a>, “PCA of high dimensional random
walks with comparison to neural network training” by Antognini and
Sohl-Dickstein, explains what’s going on with the neural networks. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3989108/">2008
paper</a>, “Interpreting
principal component analyses of spatial population genetic variation” by
Novembre and Stephens, explains what’s going on with genetics.</p>
<p>Here’s my understanding of the story, reconstructed in part from <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1391701/principal-component-analysis-pca-results-in-sinusoids-what-is-the-underlying/1392332">this Stack
Exchange
answer</a>.</p>
<p>Recall how PCA works: it tries to come up with orthogonal axes that eat up as
much of the variance of the data as possible. One way to think about this is
that it tries to come up with a rotation (“orthogonal transformation”) of the
data that de-correlates the variance over each axis. In other words, it finds a
way to diagonalize the covariance matrix of the dataset.</p>
<p>Okay, in symbols: if ($ X $) is the matrix whose rows are data points and
columns are fields, and if your data is “centered” at the origin, then ($ X^TX
$) is the covariance matrix whose entries give the covariance between pairs of
fields. If ($ E $) is the transformation, then the goal is to select ($ E $)
such that ($ (XE)^T(XE) = E^T(X^TX)E $) is a diagonal matrix; that is, ($ E $)
diagonalizes ($ X^TX $). Having done that, our projected path will be the
(first few columns of) the matrix ($ XE $).</p>
<p>It turns out that ($ XE $) diagonalizes ($ X X^T $). You can see that by just
writing it out: ($ (XE)^T XX^T (XE) = E^T (X^TX)^2 E $). Of course an
eigenvalue of ($ A $) is also an eigenvalue of ($ A^2 $) and therefore ($ E $)
diagonalizes ($ (X^TX)^2 $) as desired. So, it suffices to study the
eigenvalues of ($ XX^T $) to learn what the projected path will look like.</p>
<p>Now let’s look carefully at ($ X X^T$), which is the “covariance” for each step
rather than for each field. The claim is that this matrix is more-or-less
<em>Toeplitz</em>, which means each row is the previous row but shifted by one spot to
the right. The reason for this is that adjacent data points are spatially
nearby and should have similar correlations. One way to think about this is
that the covariances are just dot-products of pairs of points, and the dot
product of points 1 and 2 should be about the same as the dot product of points
2 and 3 if your steps are approximately evenly-spaced.</p>
<p>Indeed this seems to be the case for the loopy path I showed above:</p>
<p><img src="static/spaghetti-shadows/toeplitz.png" alt="Toeplitz matrix"></p>
<p>If the matrix is truly approximately <em>Toeplitz</em>, then multiplying by it is a
convolution by the first row (just look at its structure!). But as we were all
taught in signal-processing class, convolution is the same as pointwise
multiplication in the Fourier domain. Okay, so what are the “eigenvectors” of
pointwise multiplication?  One-hot vectors, of course! (Unless your convolution
happens to have two frequencies with exactly the same amplitude, in which case
you can get some mixing.) Finally, taking the inverse Fourier transform of
these one-hot vectors, we recover sinusoidal eigenvectors. Here’s a plot of the
top 3 eigenvectors for my running example:</p>
<p><img src="static/spaghetti-shadows/eig.png" alt="eigenvectors"></p>
<p>To recap: beware of periodic structures in PCA projections! PCA on
high-dimensional trajectories gives loopy projections because their covariance
matrices tend to be Toeplitz, yielding sinusoidal eigenvectors. Or,
high-dimensional spaghetti casts spirali-shaped shadows!</p>
<hr>
<p>Here’s a bit of Python code to explore this phenomenon further on a random
walk of 200 steps in 1024-dimensional space.</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# build a path and center it
position = np.zeros(1024)
X = []
for i in range(200):
    position = position + np.random.randn(1024)
    X.append(position)
X = np.array(X)
scaler = StandardScaler(copy=False)
scaler.fit(X)
X = scaler.transform(X)

# plot the PCA projection on some components
p = PCA(n_components=5)
p.fit(X)
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection=&#39;3d&#39;)
ax.plot(
    p.transform(X)[:, 0],
    p.transform(X)[:, 3],
    p.transform(X)[:, 4]
)

# plot the Toeplitz matrix
plt.figure()
plt.imshow(np.dot(X, X.transpose()))

# plot the eigenvalues of the Toeplitz matrix
plt.figure()
plt.plot(np.linalg.eig(np.cov(X))[1][:, :4])
